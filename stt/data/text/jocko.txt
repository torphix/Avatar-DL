this conversation was intense and too the point | lex
we agreed to talk again, probably many times | lex
but what i find very interesting, aside | lex
from the talk of leadership | lex
check them out in the description to support this podcast | lex
since this is the fourth of july, a holiday in the united states | lex
but of course who i really am is an american | lex
but this is the country, where if i'm clever enough | lex
i love america, i also love humanity | lex
they're all manifestations of the human spirit, longing to strive | lex
for a better world, i was born a russian | lex
but i believe i will die an american, a proud american | lex
hopefully not to soon, but uh | lex
is it tragic or beautiful to you that  | lex
i think it's both | jocko
both tragic and beautiful, and | jocko
for the obvious reasons | jocko
well its tragic because a lot of people die | jocko
to break once you've been through them | jocko
what is it about | lex
the trauma of war | lex
that makes bonds difficult to break | lex
because what you realize when you're in a war | jocko
is that, the people that are next to you | jocko
you rely on them and they're relying on you to survive | jocko
to live | jocko
that forms a very strong bond | jocko
and there is nothing like that team | lex
outside of the realm, of war | lex
i don't know because i'v | jocko
and the consequences of war | jocko
there could be similar situations in | jocko
in survival scenarios, in various atrocities where | jocko
and um | lex
but once you open up | lex
what does that do with those civilians, well it gives them | jocko
and they form | jocko
some sort of connection, some sort of bond | jocko
now to make that bond a little bit stronger | jocko
get done with that and | jocko
maybe you go to an airborne division so you got to airborne school | jocko
there was a shared suffering | jocko
to survive | jocko
so in your podcast and in your writing, you talk about | lex
is uh tactics | lex
and sort of the details | lex
of of combat | lex
but allow me to stick on world war two for a second | lex
theirs a particular aspect to that war | lex
i don't know if you can speak to it, where | lex
twice the number of civilians die than military personel | lex
so the soviet union especially | lex
uh | lex
my grandfather was a machine gunner | lex
a war that lacks tactics, that | lex
lacks strategy | lex
throwing bodies | lex
and bullets | lex
into a mix togther where millions die | lex
and that in particular felt much less like | lex
conflict | lex
and much more like | lex
torture or suffering? | lex
it didn't it didn't | lex
for country for love of country | lex
it's awful | jocko
i think its safe to say that | jocko
the soviet union was facing an existential threat | jocko
to their existance, against the nazis, so | jocko
to not fight | jocko
would be to | jocko
on your knees | jocko
and i think the choice was pretty clear | jocko
as far as the tactics go | jocko
i mean there is, this is attrition warfare | jocko
and the soviet union had a lot of bodies | jocko
more than the germans | jocko
its an awful way | jocko
you often talk about leadership | lex
lets put the evils of hitler aside | lex
or insane | lex
he did not see uh | lex
basically | lex
and | jocko
made decisions that where bad | jocko
that cost him dearly | jocko
but you know as mentioned, in the beginning with blitzcraig | jocko
you can win | jocko
many people consider that war a just war | lex
what do you think makes a just war | lex
i think you have the nazis | jocko
and the imperial japanese trying to impose their will on | jocko
believe its just to step in and do something about it | jocko
is there some grey area here | lex
theres theres nothing but grey area | jocko
how do you draw the line through the grey area | lex
what what war should we engage in and not | lex
i know you don't get into politics much | lex
but the decision to go to war | lex
you have to look at the situation that you are going into and you have to make sure that you have | jocko
your | jocko
troops are going to die | jocko
and maybe we think | jocko
the soviet union versus the nazis | jocko
thats total war | jocko
and america dosn't fight like that very often | jocko
in fact the last time we fought like that was world war two | jocko
and i don't think we think about that very often | jocko
to use nuclear weapons | lex
its interesting to think about | lex
into morality | lex
is not just about winning the war but should we do this | lex
and doing the calculation of human life | lex
usually those decisions are made by the leaders | lex
not by | lex
the the soldier thats going to be implementing | lex
that uh the decision | lex
do you put some responsibility i should even say blame | lex
given the war that you where involved in in iraq | lex
is there some criticism here that you can apply to leaders | lex
natural | lex
thats where i have a more significant problem | jocko
than someone that makes a mistake | jocko
we don't have enough of that | jocko
saying that i made a mistake | lex
that resulted in the loss at scale of human life | lex
can i ask you about the loss of human life | lex
a fit of rage that goes and kills somebody | jocko
sociopath | jocko
right, they're not going to feel anything | jocko
that person deserved to die and died if you got a | jocko
they'll move through that | jocko
not feel good about it later | jocko
you said move through that | lex
when they kill another soldier | lex
a realisation that its just another human being | lex
aspect that your talking about | jocko
and and what i've said is that | jocko
in when we where in iraq | jocko
they've been dehumanized | jocko
my uncle or my brother | jocko
subhumans | jocko
iraqi kids that are living under this sadistic | jocko
sadistic terror | jocko
when its not the kind of case that you are talking about | jocko
even now | lex
there | lex
which is they're the other | lex
a very large | lex
population that um | lex
that may ultimately lead to conflict | lex
similar to the soviet union conflict | lex
with uh with germany | lex
its kids and then they're dehumanized | lex
through starvation through camps | lex
and i'm not always so sure thats the case | lex
again hopefully i'm not being to dramatic | lex
but i i see that theres a kind of brewing of | lex
you see that with china you see that a little bit with russia | lex
but thats the kind of conflicts i'm referring to and um | lex
and theres a line in it | lex
on our brothers in arms | lex
do you think theres some sense in which | lex
in engaging | lex
in military conflict | lex
as much as we have | lex
or is fool a very inappropriate word here | lex
but if their is a | jocko
bear or a wolf | jocko
that is trying to get into your house | jocko
try and defend your family your way of life | jocko
should be the last resort | jocko
should be the last resort | jocko
you had a conversation with jordan peterson | lex
in a time of no war | lex
you said yes but | lex
and it so happens that jordan didn't let you finish | lex
can you uh can you elaborate what follows the but | lex
so | jocko
they don't really get tested | jocko
and they don't really struggle | jocko
and if you don't struggle you don't grow so thats the but | jocko
right um | jocko
or in combat | jocko
you mentioned the worst | jocko
what are some of the worst aspects of when you where in iraq | lex
what are the things that um | lex
the hardest on you | lex
having my guys killed | jocko
is there a a | lex
cruelty to it | lex
of fighting | lex
is there any difference is that at the end its just losing those | lex
