65_peter_singer|HIS EARLY DAYS OF DEVELOPMENT BUT IRS STILL AIMING TO
65_richard_karp|FROM THE TWO CENTRES OF THE CIRCLES
65_sheldon_solomon|FACT I THINK ITD COSTS EIGHTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS ANU TO PRODUCE THEM
66_ben_goertzel|CONFUSING WAY SO THAT HUMAN BEINGS COULD NEVER QUITE
66_joscha_bach|EVEN AS FAR AS NICYA OR ZI A WE TALKING ABOUT PLATO AND NERTHAON I THINK THAT NICHA IS THE CLASSICAL EQUIVALENT OF A SHIP POSTER
66_matt_botvinick|TO YOU TRULY SEE
66_russ_tedrake|NOT TO STIR UP TROUBLE
66_sergey_levine|BUT I WONDER HOW MUCH
66_steven_pressfield|RELEASE JUST OVER TEN YEARS AGO
67_david_patterson|BASIC OPERATIONS
67_ian_hutchinson|AS I JUST FINISHED
67_jitendra_malik|OF WHAT VISUAL PROCESSING AS A SUB CONSCIOUS AR UNCONSCESS
67_joscha_bach|ALL TRAVELL IS ONE WHERE YOU DON'T TAKE YOURSELF SERIOUSLY IF FROM NOTI I THINK THAT YOU
67_karl_friston|WAS OF COURSE THE FUNCTUAL INTEGRATION
67_robert_langer|IT'S MORE SPONTANEOUS I MEAN
68_david_patterson|WHAT LA HOW MANY SURPRISES ALONG THE WAY WERE YOU'S GOING TO SET BACK AND SAID A WAL
68_dileep_george|HOW THE SIST ME SUPPOSED TO WORK HOW THE PEACES ARE SUPPOSED TO FIT TOGETHER WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO CONTRIBUTE YOU CAN'T YOU CANT BUILD IT
68_karl_friston|HOW ALL OF THESE
68_manolis_kellis|A CONTINUUN LIKE INHERITANCE BATTER
68_matt_botvinick|AS IS THAT E PERSONAL STATEMENT IS TAT IUNHOPEFUL IS THAT IS THAT AA HOPEFUL OR REALISTIC STATEMENT SO CERTAINLY YOU WILL BE
68_peter_singer|THEY SHOW SPONSIBI MASTER CLASS
68_richard_karp|WELL ANY ANY SIGNAN JOINING THE
68_robert_langer|PART OF ITS EXPOSURE TO THINGS PART OFITS
68_sheldon_solomon|YOU GET TEN DOLLARS AND CASH APLE ALSO DO ANY TEN DOLLARS THE FIRST
68_steven_pressfield|BUT IS STILL AIMING TOO
69_ben_goertzel|BUT EVENTUALLY
69_david_eagleman|BY REWIRING ITSELF WITH THE AVAILABLE REAL ESTATE
69_françois_chollet|WHAT PHILOSOPHERS THINKERS OR IDEAS HAD A BIG IMPACT ON YOU GROWING UP
69_grant_sanderson|FINALLY THE SHOWS PRESENTED BY CASHA
69_jitendra_malik|A LIKE PROVING A MATHEMATICAL TIRUM OR PLAYING CESS
69_joscha_bach|IF YOU ARE A PHILOSOPHER BELIEF IS NOT AVERBE
69_kate_darling|VIOLENTLY I DON'T KNOW IF YOU COULD SAY ABUSE BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT ACTUALLY
69_manolis_kellis|AND HE YOU KNOW WROTE A SERIES OF PAPERS THAT SSTILL ARE VERY RELEVANT TO DAY D
69_matt_botvinick|IN YOUR FEELING IN SOME NUMBER OF YEARS BUT THAT NUMBER OF YEARS COULD BE TWO HUNDRED THREE HUNDRED YEARS FROM NO WELL THERE'S
69_robert_langer|SOMETHING THAT IHAVE EVER DONE

70_grant_sanderson|NUMBLE ONE FINANCE AP IN THE AFS DOR
70_joscha_bach|OF SOMETHING EXISTING AT ALL RATITS STUNNING WHEN YOU REALIZED SOMETHING EXISTS
70_kate_darling|ABUSING THE INNER MIND OF THE ROBOT THE ROBOT IS AND DOESN'T HAVE ANY FEELINGS FAR AS YOU KNOW
70_manolis_kellis|ABOUTER OF THES
70_peter_singer|TO GET A DISCOUNT AND TO SUPPORT THIS PODCASS
70_sergey_levine|IS REQUIRES YOU TO HAVE A KIND OF
70_sheldon_solomon|AND NOW HERE'S MY CONVERSATION WITH SHELDEN
71_ben_goertzel|WERE KIND OF TRIVIAL NOT THAT INTERESTING SO HAT IT
71_brian_kernighan|IS MY CONVERSATION
71_david_patterson|MAYBE HI'S GOING TO DOUBLE EVERY TWO YEARS AND THAT O WHAT OTHER PEOPLE SINCE
71_dileep_george|AH IS THE SIMUATION AT THE LEVEL OF A INDIVIDUAL NURONS
71_grant_sanderson|HEN YOU GET IT YOUSE COED LEX POTCAT
71_ian_hutchinson|POWER DAT HAS BEEN A POWERFUL EDITION
71_joscha_bach|RATHER THAN NOTHING AND THIS SEEMS TO BE TRUE RIGHT AS TO ABS ABSOLUTE TRUTHON IN THE FACT THAT SOMETHING SEEMS TO BE HAPPENING
71_manolis_kellis|MEN DEALING INHERITANCE OF CONTINIUM LIKE TRADES
71_matt_botvinick|ITS ITS BOTH IN THE SENSE THAT
71_robert_langer|SO IN THE SPACE OF IDEAS
71_russ_tedrake|YOU CAN CHOOSE FROM NEARLY ONE HUNDRED DIFFERENT COUNTRIES
71_sara_seager|BUT IS STILL AIMING TO
71_sergey_levine|IU ARE UMHUMAN SO ITS HARD FOR ME TO INTROSPECT ALL THE KNOWLEDGE I HAVE ABOUT THE WORLD BUT IT SEEMS LIKE THERE MIGHT BE
72_david_eagleman|FOR TO CREATE THIS THING WE HAVE FAUGHT IN OUR SKULL
72_dileep_george|YUP SO
72_françois_chollet|ANOTHER BOOK THAT I AREAD AROUND THE SAME TIME THAT HAD BIG INPACKED ON ME
72_grant_sanderson|GASH UP LES YOU SAID MYTO FRIENDS
72_ian_hutchinson|TO THE WHOLE REGIME OF STRETCHING ICE MISSAGE AND SLEEP AND DIET THAT I DO
72_jitendra_malik|IT'S OPERATING BELOW THAT
72_karl_friston|DEN'T EVEN THINK ABOUT THAT THAT INDEED THE IMPLICIT
72_kate_darling|RISE A SIMILAR CONNECTION FROM LIKE IF YOU PLAY VIOLENT FIT YOUR GAMES
72_matt_botvinick|THIS IS WHAT I
72_sheldon_solomon|WELL FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE THE UNIQUELY HUMAN AWARENESS OF DEATH
72_steven_pressfield|YOU GET TEN DOLLARS
73_david_patterson|AND WHEN GORDON MORE MITH THAT PREDICTION HE HE
73_dileep_george|THE BLUE PRAIN PROJECT ORIGINAL IDEA AS PROPOSED WAS AM YOU YOU PUT
73_sara_seager|SO GAIN YE GET CASHAFT FROM THE APSTORGU PLAY
73_sergey_levine|BECAUSE WE HAVE
73_sheldon_solomon|OUR UNWILLINGNESS TO ACCEPT THAT FACT
74_ben_goertzel|PHILOSOPHICAL SCREED ABOUT THE
74_françois_chollet|IS A CLASSIC AND THE EIR'S DISVISION OF THE MIND AS
74_kate_darling|DESENSITIZATION TO VIOLENCE AS AT THE EEVENTA HAVEBEEN READ LITERATURE ON THAT I WONDER ABOUT THAT
74_manolis_kellis|IS SOMETHING THAT PRECEDES THERE SO EVEN THOUGHIS DISCREET
74_richard_karp|AND THIS HAS TO BE AT LEAST AS LONG AS THE SHORTEST PATH WHICH IS THE STRAIGHT LINE THE STRAIGHT LINE YE WHA THE YEH THAT IS THAT
74_robert_langer|SO N THAT MAY LEAD TO OTHER THINGS
74_russ_tedrake|TO SUPPORT THI SPOTCAS
74_sergey_levine|PRIOR EXPERIENCE TO DRAW N A AND
74_steven_pressfield|AN ORGANIZATION TT IS HELPING ADVANCED ROBODICS AND STEM EDUCATION FOR YOUNG PEOPLE OR ON THE WORLD
75_ben_goertzel|PATHETIC AND HOPELESS NATURE OF OF HUMATIA AND AND ALL HUMAN THOUGHT
75_david_eagleman|EXACTLY LIKE IF YOU
75_dileep_george|A MODAL USING A THE A IDEACAL HORCHKIN HUXLEY MODALS WHICH ARE ABOUT
75_françois_chollet|A MELTISCALE HIACHY OF TAMPOR PREDICTION MARDYRS
75_grant_sanderson|TO MEET GOOD DESIGNS WHEN EVERYTHING IS EASY AND NATURAL
75_ian_hutchinson|MOSTLY NORMAL PEOPLE LIKE ME
75_jitendra_malik|RESEARCHES FOR EXAMPLE
75_kate_darling|BECAUSE EVERYTHING I'VE HEARD PEOPLE DON'T SEEM TO ANY LONGER BE SO WORRIED ABOUT
75_steven_pressfield|HERE'S MY CONVERSATION
76_brian_kernighan|VERY LARGE ROOMS AND YOU USE THINGS LIKE
76_david_patterson|SO IF YOU WERE IN
76_françois_chollet|AND HIS I DIS RESAN I SAID WITH ME
76_joscha_bach|YE IT ACTS ON SOME SUBSTRAT AND AS A RISULT YOU GET EMERGENT PARENTS MOST A SUBSTECT
76_kate_darling|VIOLET VIDIO GAMES CORRECT WE SEEMED THAT THE THE RESEARCH ONNET IS
76_matt_botvinick|PREGMATIC IN THE SENSE THAT
76_peter_singer|CREATOR OF SOME CITY AND SYMS AND GAME DESIGN
76_russ_tedrake|WHAT IS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL MOTION OF A ANIMAL OR ROBA
76_sara_seager|AND CASH APPLE ALSO TE NAT TENDOLLS THE FIRST
76_steven_pressfield|MODEST SOCIETY MANY WAYS DREAMS OF CREATING UNIVERSAL PEACE
77_ben_goertzel|HE WAS A BIT DIFFERENT HE WAS HUMAN FOCUSED RIGHT T HIS MAIN THING WAS
77_brian_kernighan|ASICY THAT SAME COMPUTER BUT
77_david_eagleman|THAT THAT WAS MY GOAL AND LIVOIR WHICH HAVE WRITEN OVER TEN YEARS BY THE WAY IS TO TRY TO DISTILL THINGS DOWN TO THE
77_françois_chollet|LAK TE DE NOTION OF AN MADIRA HAAQUI AM
77_grant_sanderson|'M LOOKING AT YOU CLIPPE
77_jitendra_malik|IS IT JUST HUMAN NATURE AS THERE'S SOMETHING FUNDAMENTAL TO THE VISION PROBLEM THAT WE
77_kate_darling|MAYBE THERE'S A INTERMEDIATE PLACE TO I DID MY RESEARCH A ON TWITTER
77_matt_botvinick|I'M NOT SURE WHAT WE'RE DOING
77_peter_singer|I PROMISE I'LL START STREAMY GAMES AT SOME POINT SOON
77_sergey_levine|OUR EFFICIENCY OUR REVOLUTIONARY FITNESS AND SO ON IS TO UTILIZE
78_david_eagleman|PRINCIPLES OF WHAT
78_david_patterson|A SET OF LAYERS OF ABSTRACTIONS AD I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT A COMPETER SCIENCE A
78_françois_chollet|OF INOPOTENCTI AND
78_jitendra_malik|WE UNDER ESTIMATE WERE STILL NOT ABLE TO BE COGNIZANT OF AL HARDTHE PROBLEMS
78_joscha_bach|SOMETHING LIKE A STOR INFORMATION THEREIS A DOWN TONE SOMETHING HERE IN HOLD STATE
78_karl_friston|IN OF ITSELF THEE
78_kate_darling|BY RESEARCH I MEAN SCOLING THROUGH YOUR TUTOR FEED YOU MENTION THAT YOU ARE GOING AT SOME POINT TO AN ANIMAL LAW CONFERENCE
78_manolis_kellis|AT A LOOK LIKE A CONTINUEN TRAIT AT CONTINUED STRAIT
78_matt_botvinick|IN EITHER IN EITHER PSYCHOLOGY OR NERO SCIENCE
78_peter_singer|A CARO SANTANA AND GUITAR
78_robert_langer|THAT WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO DO SOMETHING LIKE THIS
78_russ_tedrake|THINK THERE'S JUST SOMETHING FUNDAMENTALLY BEAUTIFUL THE ONES IN PARTICULAR THAT STEVE COLLONS BUILT WITH ANDY RUENA
78_sara_seager|HERE'S MY CONVERSATION WITH SARAH
79_david_eagleman|PLASTIC SYSTEMS ARE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH
79_david_patterson|FUND OF MENTALS AS THE THESE THINGS ARE REALLY COMPLICATED IN THE WAY WE COPE WITH
79_dileep_george|GOD GUESTS WORK
79_kate_darling|SO I HAVE TO ASK YOU THINK THERE'S SOMETHING THAT WE CAN LEARN
79_manolis_kellis|UT INSTEAD OF FIVE THERE ARE THOUSANDS AND EVERY ONE OF THEM CONTRIBUTES TO LESS THAN ONE MILLION METRR
79_matt_botvinick|IF THAT'S NOT THE FRAMING
79_richard_karp|ABOUT GEOMETRY
79_robert_langer|I MEAN THERE WE HAD TO INVENT SOMETHING THAT WOULD DO THAT BUT OTHER TIMES
79_russ_tedrake|A THREE D WALKING MACHINES
79_steven_pressfield|IF YOU COULD IMAGINE A WORLD WITHOUT WAR HOW WOULD THAT WORLD BE DIFFERENT
80_joscha_bach|SO IN IN SOME SENSE BOTH COUNTRIES LOST THEIR INTELLECTUAL TRADITIONS IN KILLING OFF AND DRIVING OUT THE JEWS DIDN'T HAP
80_karl_friston|THE PROBLEM IS YOU ARE LOOKING AT ELECTROMAGNETIC SIGNALS THAT HAVE PASSED THROUGH AN ENORMOUS
80_peter_singer|AND MANY MORE
80_richard_karp|BEYOND DISPUTE BY PURE
80_russ_tedrake|WAS NOT CONFINED TO A BOOM OR A PLAN
80_sergey_levine|THE BEAUTIFUL PICTURE THE HOPEFUL ONE
80_sheldon_solomon|PEDANTIC I USUALLY STAR
81_david_patterson|RE AH YOU NO SUSPEND DIS BELIEF AND PRETEND AH THAT
81_dileep_george|RETY SOPHISTIGATED
81_françois_chollet|WAS TE NIGHT IT WAS CANNANEU TIMIA DETARMAE ATA RIDOFT AT TA TIME

81_ian_hutchinson|HERE'S MY CONVERSATION
81_joscha_bach|AA
81_karl_friston|THE SECOND LEVEL OF RESPONDEN T YOUR QUESTION WHAT WHAT ARE THEY YEAT FROM THE OUTSIDE WHAT AD TE
81_kate_darling|OH I THINK THERE IS SO MUCH TO LEARN FROM THAT I'M ACTUALLY WRITING A BOOK ON IT RIGHT NOW THAT'S ONE GOING TOS CONFERENCE SO
81_peter_singer|CHRIS HAD FIELD EXPLAINING HOW ROCOUS WORK
81_richard_karp|REASONING
81_robert_langer|HOW COMPLICATED IS THE BIOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY OF THE HUMAN BODY FROM THE A
81_sergey_levine|I THINK IT'S POTENTIALLY A LITTLE BUT MORE THAN JUST THAT IM
82_david_eagleman|FIRSTOF ALL JUST THIST DEPOSON ET I MEAN THAT'S KINDOF THAT'S AMAZING
82_david_patterson|ALL YOU KNOW IS THIS INNER FACE THERE'S A SET OF A
82_françois_chollet|AND YEND THE NOTION THAT
82_joscha_bach|THE LOW HANGING FOOTS IN PHILOSOPHY WERE MOSLY WREPT
82_kate_darling|IM IA'M WRITING A BOOK THAT LOOKS AT THE HISTORY OF ANIMAL DOMESTICATION AND HOW WE'VE USED ANIMALS FOR WORK FOR WEAPONRY FOR COMPANIONSHIP AND
82_manolis_kellis|SO VITELY EVENING YOU'RE SHORTER HAN YOU WERE YOU WALK UP WITH IS OT WEIRD THAN
82_matt_botvinick|ENTERPRISE IS NOT ABOUT
82_peter_singer|AND THE EXPERIENCE OF BEING LAUNCHED INTO SPACE ALONE IS WORTH THE MONEY
82_robert_langer|PRORSPECTIVE OF TRYING TO EFFECT SOME PARTS OF IT IN A POSITIVE WAY ITS BUT SOT SO THAT YOU KNOW FROM ME ESPECIALLY COMING FROM A
82_sara_seager|REMEMBER WATCHING THE MOON AND I WAS IN THE CAR WITH MY DAD WHO MY PARENTS WERE DIVORCED AND HE WAS DRIVING ME IN MY SIBLINGS TO HIS HOUSE FOR THE WEEK END
82_sergey_levine|AND THIS IS THIS IS WHERE WE PERHAPS REACH THE LIMITS OF OUR CURRENT UNDERSTANDING BUT
82_steven_pressfield|THE SAME CREATURES INTERNALLY THAT WE WERE IN THE CAVE
83_ben_goertzel|MORE LITERARY TYPE WRITING WE TALK ABOUT SOME OF THOSE THINGS SO ON THE SALARA SIDE SANASAPHLAM A
83_brian_kernighan|DOES IT ALL WORK IN THE BEGINNING AS TO THE ANSWERS I DON'T HAVE A CLUE I THINK THE BASIC IDEA WAS NOTHING MORE THAN
83_david_eagleman|HATS THAT SIR
83_françois_chollet|YET THE DARK MULGIPOLE SCARCE OF PROCESSING A INTER BRAIN
83_grant_sanderson|STEM EDUCATION
83_ian_hutchinson|PLASMOPHYSICS WHAT IS THE DISTINCTION
83_kate_darling|SEA O
83_richard_karp|THAN THE EARLIER MATHEMATICS COURSES WHICH WERE MOSTLY ABOUT
83_robert_langer|THE FIELD OF COMPUTER SCIENCE AND COMPUNIGENEERING RUBOTICS
83_sara_seager|ANDTHE MOON WAS JUST FOLLOWING ME
83_sergey_levine|ONE THING THAT I HINK THAT
84_ben_goertzel|THIS KIND OF IDEA OF THERE BEING INTELLIGENCES OUT THERE THAT ARE DIFFERENT THAN OUR OWN
84_david_eagleman|I DON'T KNOW F PEOPLE QUITE
84_françois_chollet|THE HIRARCHI YES THIS IS LI AWORD DEEP LEARNING THESE IDEAS OF HAIAKIIS INEA I HAVE BEEN AROUND FOR A LONG TIME
84_jitendra_malik|HE HEAD OUT MANY PROBLEMS IN VISION WERE
84_karl_friston|CALL UPON THE MATHEMATICS OF BLOBS
84_kate_darling|WHAT WE DO TO ANIMALS AS LIKE SIMILAR THE WAY WE VIEW LIKE THE HOLLICOSTS
84_manolis_kellis|BE DIFFERENT YET SO SO THERE ARE SELECTIVE ADVANTAGES TO BEING MEDIUM
84_richard_karp|ARITHMETIC OPERATIONS AND MANIPULATING THEM
84_russ_tedrake|JUST FALLS DOWN THE RAMP
84_sara_seager|JUST HAD NO IDEA WHY THAT WAS
84_sergey_levine|THE RESISH COMMUNITY HASN'T REALLY RESOLVE IN A SATISFACTORY WAY IS
85_ben_goertzel|DETECT THEIR THEIR INTELLIGENCE OR APPRECIATE THEIR INTELLIGENCE YES SO MY FRIEND
85_brian_kernighan|SOMETHING THAT WERE YOU COULD ACTUALLY
85_david_patterson|YOU CAN LOOK AT A FOR BLOTS OF PIECES OF SALPHOR THAT YOU USE YOU CAN SEE EXACTLY WHAT THE PROGRAMMER DOES IF YOU WANT O
85_dileep_george|I WOULD SAY A
85_grant_sanderson|HERE'S MY CONVERSATION
85_joscha_bach|SPELL IT OUT AND THIS INSIDE IS
85_peter_singer|IS MY CONVERSATION WITH PETER
85_russ_tedrake|AND AT THE TIME IT LOOKED MORE NATURAL MORE GRACEFUL MORE HUMAN LIKE THAN ANY
85_sara_seager|I THINK IT'S ONE OF THE GREAT THINGS ABOUT BEENIKID IT'S JUST THAT CURIOSITY THAT THAT ALL KIDS HAVE
85_sheldon_solomon|BUT LET MEY GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE IT IF IM
86_ian_hutchinson|RESEACH HAS MOSTLY BEEN AIMED AT
86_jitendra_malik|GETTING TO NINETY NINE PER CENT MAY TAKE YOU FIVE YEARS AND
86_joscha_bach|THERE IS THE WAY IN WHICH MATHEMATICS AND PHILOSOPHY OUGHT TO MEET
86_karl_friston|SPECIALLY RESTRICTED PART OF THE BRAIN IT CREATES A BLOB
86_sara_seager|YOU'RE AWAS THINKING A THERE'S TES A
87_david_patterson|HAS PEENDENT EFFORT TO MAKE E
87_dileep_george|WHAT SEE THE CORRECTNESS THAT'S INTERESTING CAUSE YOUV MENTIONED AT SEVERAL LEVELS A THE CORRECTNESS IS MEASURED BY LOOKING SOME KIND OF AGGREGASTATISTICS
87_françois_chollet|PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTITION IN DEPLANNING
87_jitendra_malik|NINETY NINE PER AN NINE NINE BLESSING MAY BE NOT IN YOUR LIFETA
87_manolis_kellis|THEY HAVE TROUBLE BREATHING OVE TROUBLE RONNEY OF TROUBLE SITTING IF YOU'RE TOO TALL
87_matt_botvinick|VIRTUAL COSAL MECHANISMS
87_richard_karp|I LACKED THREE DIMENSIONAL VISION I WASN'T VERY GOOD
87_steven_pressfield|YOU KNOW A VOI TOTAL COMMITMENT
88_françois_chollet|HAT ABOUT THE MEMORY SIDE OF THINGS I THINK HE IS TALKING ABOUT KNOWLEDGE REPRESENTATION
88_jitendra_malik|WOATD OF THAS UNIQUE DIVISION
88_kate_darling|SO THINGS THAT AT THE TIME PEOPLE DIDN'T SEE
88_robert_langer|SO IF YOU START TO THINK ABOUT CONTROLLING VARIOUS ASPECTS OF A WHEN WE TALK ABOUT DRUG DELIVERY LITT A BIT BUT
88_sara_seager|AND IT MADE ME THINK IN I WONDER I FIRST REALIZED THAT
89_brian_kernighan|TE SAME VIEW OF COMPUTING FOR THE MASSES LET'S CALL IT THE IDEA THAT YOU KNOW
89_david_patterson|RE YOU THINKING ALSO WHEN YOU SAY OPEN SOURCE AT THE HARDWARE LEVEL IS THIS GOING TO THE
89_jitendra_malik|TO A SOLVE THAT PROBLEM
89_karl_friston|AM HOW THE BRAIN
89_kate_darling|OU KNOWS THAT  LOOK AT EVERYTHING FROM AS SLAVERY
89_manolis_kellis|IF YOU LOOK AT NATURAL HISTORY OF HUMAN POPULATION THERE'S ACTUALLY SELECTION FOR HEIGHT
89_robert_langer|CONTROLLING VARIOUS ASPECTS CHEMICALLY OF THE HUMAN BODY IS THERE A SOLID UNDERSTANDING ACROSS THE POPULATIONS OF HUMAN AN
89_sara_seager|THE EARTH IS ZAM
89_sergey_levine|A LARGE MASS OF SORT OF IIDE SAMPLES OF THE WORLD IS S A VERY DIFFICULT WAY TO GO BUT
89_steven_pressfield|WOULD BE IN
90_ben_goertzel|DAME THING WE CAN DO ABOUT IT
90_david_eagleman|ANND SO ON
90_david_patterson|DESIGN ARCHITECTURE INSTRUCTIONS SET LEVEL OR IS I GOING TO LITERALLY
90_dileep_george|SO THOSE MORELS ARE SOPHISTICATED
90_françois_chollet|YOUR MEMORIZING THINGS
90_grant_sanderson|ONE THING THAT JUST REALLY STRUCK ME
90_ian_hutchinson|OF THOSE STATES OF MATTER
90_kate_darling|YOU KNOW WE SEE HIS ATROCITIES BUT AT THE TIME PERHAPS DIDN'T AS MUCH AND SOD NOW
90_matt_botvinick|I MANAGED TO A
90_robert_langer|OR UNDERSTAND I MEAN THEN THAT THAT MIGHT BE SUCH A KNOB
91_dileep_george|BUT GETTING AIR SINGLE NURONZ MODEL
91_françois_chollet|BUT IT DOES NOT SEEM TO BE
91_ian_hutchinson|AND IT'S ACTUALLY THE STATE OF MATTER WHICH ONE REACHES
91_joscha_bach|A BEST PAPER IN EUROPE'S
91_karl_friston|ENGAGES WITH THE WORLD
91_matt_botvinick|I MANAGED TO
91_robert_langer|SO WHAT IS A FARMOCITICAL DRUG
91_russ_tedrake|IT LOSES A LITTLE ENERGY
91_sara_seager|EH IT'S NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE NONE OF US ARE LUCKY TO GO TO SEE THE CURVATURE OF EARTH
91_sergey_levine|SUPERVISION TO TELL ME NOT TO DO DOSE TOSE BAD THINGS AND TO KEEP DOING THE GOOD THINGS
92_david_patterson|SOFPHWER
92_dileep_george|NINETY NINE PERSON RIT
92_ian_hutchinson|IF ONE RAISES THE TEMPERATURE
92_matt_botvinick|A SOOTHE MY OWN NERVES BY THINKING ABOUT
92_peter_singer|MYENTIRE FAMILY CONSTAN SOVIENIAN ASBORN AND SYLVIIAN
92_sergey_levine|SO THERE'S A SPECTION BETWEEN AI I D
93_françois_chollet|OR DOESNOT HAVE THE SAME RICH COMPLEXITY LONG TERM NATURE THIS IN OUR BRAINS YES
93_grant_sanderson|MILDLY SEXIS WOMANIZING PHILANDERER AT LEAST ON THE PERSONAL SIDE
93_joscha_bach|W MIGHT BE ABLE TO SOFT SOME OF THE BIGGER PROMPTS THAT INSTEAD OF E I
93_manolis_kellis|YOU KNOW FOR MANY MANY TRAITS THERE'S A LOT OF PUSH TOWARDS THE MIDDLE
93_richard_karp|ANDICE COMES AS A SURPRISE THAT THAT CAN BE DONE
93_russ_tedrake|THOSE THINGS CAN COME INTO PERFECT BALANCE
93_sheldon_solomon|REMEMBER READING THAT
94_ben_goertzel|SELF ORGANIZATION AND I'M IN
94_grant_sanderson|BUT YOU READ THIS LETTER AND I CAN TRY TO PULL IT UP FOR YOU IF I WANT AND IT'S JUST THIS ABSOLUTELY HARTFELT LETTER TO HIS WIFE SAYING HOW MUCH HE LOVES HER
94_kate_darling|I DON'T SEE
94_matt_botvinick|I YOU KNOW CON PRODUCTIVELY INVESTIGATING
94_robert_langer|WELL IAL GIVE AN EXAMPLE WHICH GOES BACK TO WHAT I SAID BEFORE SO WHEN I WAS DOING MY POST DOCTORAL WORK WITH JUDAFOLKMAN A
94_russ_tedrake|AND ACTUALLY THEY THEY WANT TO HAT'S A STABLE PHENOMENON IF IT'S GOING TO SLOW IT'LL SPEED UP
94_sara_seager|IKE TO LAY OUT OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM
94_sheldon_solomon|AND I'VE IN MY GOT AS I CO MAN
95_brian_kernighan|WORKED ON MODELS OF WHAT WAS GOING ON
95_david_patterson|SO THOSE INSTRUCTIONS ARE LIKEWHILY TALKED ABOUT EARLIER THATE CAN BE INSTRUCTIONS LIKE ADS SUBTRACT AND MULTIPLY DIVIDE THERE'S INSTRUCTIONS TO
95_dileep_george|HA AND IF YOU IF YOU JUST
95_françois_chollet|VERY PRECISELY LIKE BEATS OF YOUR EXPERIENTS
95_jitendra_malik|YA SO VISON OPERATES AT A AT ALL LEVILS AND THERE ARE PARTS WHICH ARE
95_karl_friston|THE NEGATIVE PART OF MY ONYELARS LETTER THEY HAV THE SIGHT OF IT AND SO I YEV E
95_peter_singer|THE WAR HAD MANY IMPACT A
95_sergey_levine|WHAT SO THIS OPEN QUESTION THAT YOU RAISED
96_david_eagleman|NEXT TIME I SEE YOUR FACE S I WILL REMEMBER O YALIC THAT TIME LEX AND I SAT TOGETHER AND WE DID THESE THINGS AND
96_david_patterson|PUT DATA INTO MEMORY
96_ian_hutchinson|THE ELECTORONTS ARE
96_jitendra_malik|WHICH ROUGHLY SPEAKING REFERRED TO
96_karl_friston|VERY
96_manolis_kellis|A COMBINATION OF A LEALS THATS RO YOU NOW KEEP RECOMBINING AND IF YOU LOOK AT YOU KNO MADE SELECTION
96_matt_botvinick|AN AND WE WE ASCRIBE TO THEM THESE CAUSAL PROPERTIES OTHERS ADOMINANT THEIRES THE RECESSIVE AND THEN THEN THEY RECOMBINE IT
96_peter_singer|I THINK ONE OF THEM
96_richard_karp|DO YOU REMEMBER WHAT IS THE PROOF THAT IT'S HONORS YOR YAS UP TO ONE AE
96_sara_seager|I THINK IT'S HARD TO SAY I HAD THIS BOOK WHEN I WAS A CHILD IT WAS IN FRENCH I GROPE IN CANADA WERE FRENCHIS
96_sergey_levine|WHERE DO YOU THINK
97_brian_kernighan|WHAT WAS DONE
97_ian_hutchinson|UNBOUND
97_kate_darling|THE FACT THAT WERE REALLY FAR AWAY DOESN'T
97_peter_singer|A BENEFICIAL IMPACT IS THAT IT SHOWED WHAT RACIISM
97_russ_tedrake|TAKE ALL THE EXTRA SPOKS AWAY
97_steven_pressfield|CERTAINLY IN
98_david_eagleman|IT WAS USEFUL FOR NOW NO ILL PROBABLY NEVER GET RIDOF IT LET'S SAFE FOR SOME CIRCUMSTANCE YOU AN I DON'T SEE EACH OTHER FOR HE NEXT THIRTY FIVE YEARS
98_grant_sanderson|BUT WHEN YOU GET INTO IT LI
98_joscha_bach|IN THE THE EARLY DAYS ONE WOULD YOU SAY FOR YOU WAS THE DREAM
98_karl_friston|AND
98_kate_darling|UT I CAN SEE BECOMING I CAN SEE BASICALLY A SIVERITE'S MOVEMENT FOR ROBATS
98_manolis_kellis|WILL NOT TEND TO SET OF MARY SUPERSPERTOL PEOPLE
98_sara_seager|IT'S HARD TO SAY HOW MUCH YOU KNOW YOU  OR I UNDERSTAND WUMERKED'S BUT IT WAS REALLY GREAT BUCK G
98_sheldon_solomon|TO RESPOND TO IT IT IS PRIMARILY RESPONSIBLE FOR ALMOST EVERYTHING WE DO WHETHER WE ARE AWARE OF IT OR NOT
99_ben_goertzel|THERE THERE THERE 'VE BEEN VARIOUS SAD TIVITIOS AND SIGNS FICTION NOVELS POSITING
99_david_eagleman|HOW MALLUABLE IS THE HUMAN BRAIN IN EACH STAGE OF LIFE SO WHAT JUST THAT AT A HIGH LEVEL
99_david_patterson|THINGS DEVICES
99_karl_friston|DESPITE HEROIC EFFORTS SO ONE HAS TO ASK IS THERE A LOWER BOUND
99_kate_darling|IN THE FUTURE DE YE THINK I NEW
99_manolis_kellis|JUST FOR SEX AND WHOM YE GET I
99_peter_singer|I THINK THAT MEANT THAT I GREW UP IN AN ARAR IN WHICH
99_richard_karp|PARALLEL TO THE OPPOSITE SIDE
99_robert_langer|TOUL BE AN ARTERY OR VEIN OR CAPILARY
99_sara_seager|WHAT ABOUT THE STARS
99_sergey_levine|SO I THINK THIS IS FIRST AN OPEN SCIENTIFIC PROBLEM AND I DON'T HAVE LIKE A A CLEAR ANSWER BUT I CAN SPECULATE A LITTLE BIT
99_sheldon_solomon|AND MOSTLY
99_steven_pressfield|A UNIVERSAL
100_david_eagleman|IS IT VALUBLE
100_grant_sanderson|I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW THAT CAN POSSIBLY BE A PUBLIC PERCEPTION ABOUT ANY PHYSICIST BUT FOR WHATEVER REASON THAT LIKE WORKED INTO HIS ORTHAT
100_joscha_bach|OR MAYBE TO CREATE HUMAN LEVEL INTELLIGENCE BORN FOR YOU
100_kate_darling|PUT IN THE FORM OF A QUESTION DO YOU THINK ROBOT SHOULD HAVE SOME KINDS OF RIGHTS
100_matt_botvinick|BECAUSE THAT'S THAT GAVE US
100_robert_langer|AND IT ITTAM
100_russ_tedrake|CAN STILL YE GIVE IT A LITTLE PUSH STARTS FALLING DOWN A RAMP
100_sergey_levine|AND WHAT I WOULD SPECULATE IS THAT
100_sheldon_solomon|IT REMINDED ME I THINK OM NOT TO PLAC PSYCHOLOGIST BUT YOU KNOW LET'S FACE IT
101_david_eagleman|AND PLASTICITY DIMINISHES BUT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I
101_david_patterson|WE THINK IT BETTER TO HAVE A PRETTY SIMPLE A SET OF INSTRUCTIONS REDUCED SET OF INSTRUCTIONS
101_dileep_george|EVEN ELET ELECTRICAL ENGINEER WOULD NOT UNDERSTAND MY PRAPROSSESSES I CUD RSISHOULSOII DONT THINK
101_grant_sanderson|HE SORT OF SHOOT OFF MATHENS IN PLACE OF DRUE SCIENCE
101_joscha_bach|I THINK THAT YOU A CAN SEE A AYE LARGELY TO DAY AS
101_karl_friston|RECURRENCE
101_kate_darling|WELL IT'S INTERESTING BECAUSE I CAME AT THIS
101_manolis_kellis|OUTSIDE OF JUST HUMANS BUT IS THERE SOMETHING THAT YOU FIND BEAUTIFUL ABOUT THE HUMAN GENOME SPECIICALLY
101_richard_karp|TRISECTS THE ANGLE
101_sara_seager|AND AGAIN IT HAD TO DO WITH MY DAD HE TOOK US CAMPING NOW MY DAD WAS FROM THE UKE
101_sergey_levine|SUPERSUPERCAREFUL
101_sheldon_solomon|I BELIEVE THERE'S HA REASON WHY WE AND UC DRIFTING
102_david_eagleman|AND I ARGUE THAT'S BECAUSE OF THE STABILITY OF THE DATA IN OTHER WORDS WHAT YOU'RE GETTING IN FROM THE WORLD
102_françois_chollet|ND INSO SO HIGHY A RIH WITH DEM LKE IMAGINE IF YOU DIDN'T HAVE LANGUAGE THEN YOU WOULD HAVE TO
102_ian_hutchinson|CONDUCTS ELECTRICITY
102_jitendra_malik|IN MANY REAL APPLICATIONS WE HAVE TO CONFRONT
102_kate_darling|ORIGINALLY FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE I WAS LIKE YOU KNOW WHAT THERE'S NO FUNDAMENTAL DIFFERENCE BETWEEN TYCHNOLOGY AND LIKE
102_matt_botvinick|YES WELL
102_peter_singer|THAT HAD EXISTED FOR MY PARENTS IN EUROPE I WAS GROWING UP IN AUSTRALIA A AND CERTAINLY THAT WAS
102_sara_seager|AND HE WAS THE TYPE WHO
102_sheldon_solomon|IT'S IN THE EVENING AND I'M JUST SITTING THERE LOOKING AT MY STAMP COLLECTION
103_ben_goertzel|ONE OF THE OTHER
103_david_patterson|IT'S NOT COMPLETELY INTRUTIVE TO ME WHY RISK HAS FOR THE MOST PART ONE YES POS SI ID THAT HAPPEN
103_grant_sanderson|AND TO SEEING THAT PHYSICS WAS A WAY TO REALIZE THAT AND ALL THE CREATIVITY THAT HE COULD OUTPUT IN THAT DIRECTION AM WAS INSTEAD PORD TOWARDS THINGS LIKE FUNDAMENTAL
103_ian_hutchinson|AS ALL SORTS OF IMPORTANT PROPERTIES THAT ARE ASSOCIATED
103_jitendra_malik|NOW HOW MUCH
103_karl_friston|ANMD I PRESUME WILL GET
103_kate_darling|HUMAN CONSCIOUSNESS LIKE WE WE CAN PROBABLY RECREATE ANYTHING WE JUST DON'T KNOW HOW YET AND SO
103_manolis_kellis|N ABOUT SIMILARITY
103_peter_singer|CLEARLY SEEN AS SOMETHING COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE
103_russ_tedrake|HERE THEY BUILT SOMETHING THAT HAD KNEES
103_sergey_levine|BEING CAREFUL TO AVOID THE USELESS STUFF AND MORE ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT YOU HIT ON THE REALLY IMPORTANT STUFF
103_sheldon_solomon|AND I MIKWAG AND A MISS MY GRANDMOTHER
104_ian_hutchinson|WITH THAT SEPARATION
104_jitendra_malik|THAT IS NECESSARY WILL DEPEND ON THE APPLICATION FOR SOME PROBLEMS IT DOESN'T MATTER FOR SOME PROBLEMS IT MATTERS A LOT
104_joscha_bach|IS A LIMITING KIND OF A ROUND OF IDEAS AND THEN THE OTHER ONE IS WHAT HE ME BY THE PHILOSOPHICAL PROJECT
104_richard_karp|AD UP TWO A HUNDRED EIGHTY DEGREES
104_russ_tedrake|ARMS AT TORSO
104_sheldon_solomon|AN N E LIKE NO WAIT IN
104_steven_pressfield|BUT IN GENERAL DO YOU THINK HAS BEEN MOST TRANSFORMAIVE FOR THE WORLD
105_brian_kernighan|EXECUTABLE CODE FROM THE FILE SYSTEM INTO THE MEMORY
105_françois_chollet|YOU SMELOSPHYSIC SMILE AND THAT BRINGS UP MEMORIES BUT YOU WOULD NOT REAVE AWAY TO DELIBRATORY DELIBERTLY ACCES HIS MEMORY
105_ian_hutchinson|AND THAT'S WHAT PLASMES ARE ALL ABOUT AND THE REASON WHY MY DEPARTMENT IS INTERESTED IN PLASMO PHYSICS VERY STRONGLY IS BECAUSE MOST THINGS
105_kate_darling|MACHINES THE SAME RIGHTS THAT WE HAVE ONCE LIKE YOU SAY THEIR KIND OF ON AN EQUIVALENT LEVEL
105_matt_botvinick|WELL EVEN IS THE INTERRUCTION OF NUERONS
105_russ_tedrake|THE ARMS SWUNG NATURALLY
105_steven_pressfield|WHEN TES AR GREAT QUESTIONS LEXS TA A EASY ONES RAGHT I MEAN I WISH I KNEW MORE ABOUT TE
106_ben_goertzel|THROUGH ALL O THE DIFFERENT SYSTEMS TO ENGINEER OR IS A
106_brian_kernighan|GIVE IT CONTROL AND THEN
106_grant_sanderson|IS THIS  CONSTANT DESIRE TO REINVENT IT FOR HIMSELF
106_ian_hutchinson|WELL FOR ONE THING MOST THINGS IN THE UNIVERSE AE PLASHMA
106_joscha_bach|OU ASK A SYSTEM WHAT IS INTELLIGENCE
106_karl_friston|PAINT THE CHALLENGE FACING AND BRANCOMPUTER INTERFACING IN TERMS OF CONTROLLING ANOTHER
106_peter_singer|ALL OF THAT HAS ITS ROOTS IN IN THE SECOND WORLD WORL
106_richard_karp|WHATSIT CALLED UM
106_russ_tedrake|I GIVE IT A LITTLE PUSH AND THAT IT LOOKED LIKE A STROLL THROUGH THE PARK
106_sara_seager|JUST COULDN'T BELIEVE THAT
107_david_patterson|WHY IS IT THAT
107_dileep_george|JUST AS THE SIMULATION
107_françois_chollet|MEMORY
107_grant_sanderson|LIKE WHEN HE WOULD CONSUME PAPERS THE WAY HE DESCRIBED IT HES HEWOULD START TO SEE WHAT PROBLEM ITWAS TRYING TO SOLVE AND THEN JUST TRY TO SOLVE IT HIMSELF TO GET A SENSE OF PERSONAL OWNERSHIP
107_karl_friston|THAT IS HIGHLY AND DEEPLY STRUCTURED
107_matt_botvinick|IS ALRIS TAT LITERALLY
107_peter_singer|YOU KNOW THERE IS MUCH BEAUTY THAT COMES FOR MORE
107_robert_langer|DELIVERING A MOLECULE FOR A LONG TIME SO IT COULD SLOWLY DIFFUSE OUT OF THAT AT A CONTROLLE RATE AH TO WHERE HE WANTED IT TO GO
107_sara_seager|INON'L SEE LIKE MY FIRST THOUGHT WAS THIS IS SO INCREDIBLE MIND BLOWING
107_sheldon_solomon|Y MOBSGOING TO BE DEAD
108_ben_goertzel|A G I WHEN I WAS
108_david_eagleman|I ID THAT THEN THE VILE COTEKS MIGHT BE MUCH LESS MALLIBLE A
108_joscha_bach|AH HOW IT WORKS
108_manolis_kellis|DIFFER IN MILLIONS OF LOCATIONS
108_robert_langer|OTHEN YOU WOULD FIND THE IDEAS THAT THERE OUD BE PARTICULAR BLOOD VESSELS
108_sheldon_solomon|I'M GOIN TO GET ALL
108_steven_pressfield|GASH WHAT'S THEN THE MOST TRANSFORMAN OF
109_david_patterson|IN THE LONG RUN PROVIDE FASTER EXECUTION VERSES
109_dileep_george|ER IN BUT NO JUST
109_françois_chollet|THE MASCO CHOMSKY QUESTION WHICH IS LIKE
109_jitendra_malik|THAT ZEADO POINT ZEADO VON
109_robert_langer|THAT YOU CAN TARGET SAY THEY'RE CONNECTED SOMEHOW TO A TUMOR THE UCUTARGET AND OVER
109_russ_tedrake|CLOSE TO THE SOLUTION
110_ben_goertzel|IT WAS REALLY
110_brian_kernighan|OTH ASSEMBLY TIS TETED TO WORK IN A BIG PICTURE
110_david_patterson|COMING UP WITH LADE SAID ATANA OF
110_françois_chollet|FORSA DO YOU THINK LANGUAGES LIKE FUNDAMENTAL
110_ian_hutchinson|THAT NEWCLY EFFUSION REACTIONS
110_joscha_bach|YETT HURING TEST IS BASICALLY A TEST OF THE CONJECTURE WHERE THE PEOPLE ARE INTELLIGENT ENOUGH TO UNDERSTAND THEMSELVES
110_karl_friston|ISI EE
110_russ_tedrake|THE CERTAINLY AREN'T IN THE WAY THAT THEY
110_sheldon_solomon|ABOUT A SCIENCE BEING SPECULATIVE
110_steven_pressfield|A BUILDING OF AMPIRE DIEVASENCE
111_kate_darling|WHY DO WE BELIEVE
111_peter_singer|THAT A THAT CAME FROM THE WAR
111_richard_karp|IN TERMS OF YA BEING  THE PUZZLES THE VISUAL ASPECTS THAT WERE FIRST SO COMPINED TO YOU
111_sara_seager|S OUR ABILITY TO ENGINEERR
111_sergey_levine|INTERESTING KIND OF WAY TO LOOK AT
111_sheldon_solomon|YOU KNOW THIS SEEMED TO BE THE MOST
112_ben_goertzel|E HAD JUST AMBITION
112_grant_sanderson|'M SURE YOU ARE CAPTURED BY SOME POSSIBILITY AND MAGIC OF IT
112_ian_hutchinson|IMPLEMENT THOSE KIND OF PHENOMENA ON EARTH
112_jitendra_malik|AH YOU CAN FIRST OF ALL THEY ARE
112_joscha_bach|IS ONE OF THE FUNDAMENTAL ASPECTS OF INTELLIGENCE SO
112_kate_darling|THAT ALL HUMANS ARE CREAATED EQUAL
112_manolis_kellis|LETS THINK SOMETHING THAT TEACHES US ABOUTS OR OF THE NATURE OF HUMANITY IN MANY WAYS
112_matt_botvinick|IS TO TAKE THESE
112_peter_singer|THE THE MIRROR THAT IT PUT TO OUR SOCIETY
112_richard_karp|NOT UCLYDIAN GEOMETRY PARTICULARLY I THINK
112_robert_langer|FRACTIONS UNIS TO GROUPS OF SUBSTANCES THAT WOULD WOULD DO IT BUT WHAT WOULD HAPPEN OVER THE NEXT
112_sara_seager|INTELLIGENT BEINGS
113_brian_kernighan|IN THREE WEEKS SIR
113_david_patterson|AND PRODUCE SIMPLER INSTRUCTIONS
113_dileep_george|HOW INTELLIGENCE THAN EMERGES ALL THAT KONDSTOFF WHAT WERE OUR WAY ON THAT TIME LINE YE
113_françois_chollet|ASPECT OF LIKE WHAT IT MEANS TO BE
113_grant_sanderson|DO YOU READ THE WORK OF OTHERS LIKE DO YOU GO THROUGH THE PROFLY DO YOU TRY TO REDISCOVER EVERYTHING YOURSELF
113_joscha_bach|I SUPPOSED TO GOAL ORIENTITES YOU SAID KIND OF PUZZLE SOLVING AS COMING TO
113_karl_friston|A VERY DELICATELY STRUCTURED DEEPLY STRUCTURED DYNAMIC
113_kate_darling|KILLING OF A HUMAN BEING NO MATTER WHO THE HUMAN BEING IS
113_richard_karp|A I USED TOOLS LIKE A LINEAF PROGRAMMING AND INTERED YOUR PROGRAMMING A LOT AND BUT
113_russ_tedrake|THEN THE FINESSE
113_sara_seager|INTELLIGENT BEINGS THAT WE COULD LOVE THAT COULD LOVE US THAT WE CAN INTRACT WITH IN SOME RICH WAYS THAUT WE HAVEN'T YET DISCOVERED
113_sergey_levine|OF THE REENFORCEING LEARNING PROBLEM AS THE CANNA THE MORE MULTY TASK THE GENERAL INTELLIGENCE KIND OF FORMULATION
113_sheldon_solomon|IT WAS ON TO SOMETHING SO II GUESS THE QUESTION I WONT TO ASK ALSO IS LIKE
113_steven_pressfield|ABOUT
114_brian_kernighan|MAYBE YOU CONVINSAND A WHIM BUT NOT REALLY BUT OF COURSE QUICKLY THAT IS NOW
114_david_eagleman|IS MAKE A SYSTEM THAT'S REALLY FLEXIBLE
114_david_patterson|YOU KNOW INSTRUCTIONS IS VERY TEDIOUS BUT THE BELIEF WAS TO WRITE THIS LOWEST LEVEL OF SOFTHWARE THAT
114_françois_chollet|E OF THE BRAIN OF THE HUMAN MIND HERE AND YOUR PAETING SYSTEM YOU KNOW IS A LAYER ON TOP OF THE COMPUTER U
114_karl_friston|AT NERO LINK
114_manolis_kellis|THE OTHER THINGS THAT MAKES INHERITANCE UNIQUE IN HUMANS IS THAT
114_russ_tedrake|BECAUSE BECAUSE THIS WAS WORKTHEYWERE WORKING WITH A SYSTEM THAT WASN'T PERFECTLY MODELLE WASN'T PERECTLY CONTROLLED
115_ben_goertzel|TO DO GOOD
115_brian_kernighan|YOU COULD THINK OF MOST THE COMPETERS IN THE WORLD RUN ON A EUNUCH'S LIKE
115_david_eagleman|AS OPPOSED TO
115_dileep_george|AH NOWEN WE LOOK BIKE
115_ian_hutchinson|WHILE FISHING IS TAKING HEAVY ELEMENTS LIKE EURANIUM
115_jitendra_malik|LETE BE ARE YOUR DOING A EMID SUCH
115_manolis_kellis|A MOST SPECIES INHERIT THINGS VERTICALLY
115_matt_botvinick|NURL EVENTS
115_richard_karp|HIDIMENSIONAL VISUALIZATION
115_robert_langer|SOMETIMES USING THE TECHNIQUS THAT WE DEVELOPED AH AND THEN
115_russ_tedrake|THERE'S ALL THESE LITTLE TRICKS
115_sergey_levine|AGAIN RIDICULOUSLY FORSACOHIA FOR QUETIONS
115_steven_pressfield|RELIGIOUS CULTURAL CONFLICT
116_david_eagleman|MOST OTHER CREATURES TO DIFFEREN DEGREES SO FUTACA AN ALLIGATOR ITS BORN ITS BRAIN DOES THE SAME THING EVERY GENERATION
116_david_patterson|THEY WERE TOO SLOW OR
116_grant_sanderson|BUT AT THER TIMES YOU DO NEED TO GET THROUGH IT AT A CERTAIN PACE YOU DO NEED TO GET TO A POINT OF A PROBLEM YOU'RE TRYING TO SOLVE SO OBVIOUSLY YOU NEED TO BE WELL EQUIPPED TO READ THINGS H
116_ian_hutchinson|AND BREAKING THEM UP
116_kate_darling|I THINK NOTSERE BUT A BE HEN FOR SUR I'S NOT CONSIDERED MURDER RIGT AH OR EVEN SHUTTING THEM OFF
116_manolis_kellis|ACICLLY INSTINCT IS A HUGE PART OF THEIR BEHAVIOR
116_peter_singer|THINK OF AS AS POSITIVE AND ANDBEAUTIFUL
116_richard_karp|AND SO I TEND TO GO BY THEE ALGEBAY PROPERTIES
116_robert_langer|SO IN GENERAL
117_ben_goertzel|FAR FAR BEYOND
117_brian_kernighan|KIND AN NEAT W I THINK THE REAL QUESTION IS WHAT DOES CAN THINK ABOUT THAT
117_david_patterson|THE THE PROGRAMES WOULD BE TOO BIG
117_dileep_george|WAT IN MINETIN O THREE
117_françois_chollet|ITS A LANGUAGES MESSY YEAH IT'S MESSY AND IT SAN E SAM
117_grant_sanderson|AH WITHOUT THAT REINVENTION COMPONENT AND SEE HOW OTHERS HAVE DONE IT
117_jitendra_malik|SOMSSOM A DESCRIPTION SOME MEASUAL DESCRIPTION
117_joscha_bach|BUT II DO FIND INTELLIGENCE THEY CAINT OU KON OF MENTION CHILDREN RIGHT THE
117_karl_friston|THE FIANIGY PRINCIPLE
117_kate_darling|SO THAT'S THAT'S WERE THE LYING
117_manolis_kellis|THE WAY THOU
117_peter_singer|IT ALSO ENGENDERS A KIND OF A NATIONALISM AND A PATRIOTISM THAT CAN'T BE QUESTIONED O
117_robert_langer|ONE OF THE KEYWAYS YOU KAN
117_russ_tedrake|STICK BUT THEN THEY RELEASE IT JUST THE RIGHT TIME OR THERE'S ALL THESE LITTLE TRICKS OF THE TRADE
117_sara_seager|WHAT WELL YET THE STARS THOUGH UNLIKE KIDS OR THE PUPPY IT'S ONLY A GOOD THING
117_steven_pressfield|I TALKED TO ERIK WASTEIN AND HE SAID EVERYTHING IS GREAT ABOUT WAR EXCEPT OF THE KILLING
118_david_eagleman|MOTHER NATURE HAS DONE WITH US
118_david_patterson|THAT WAS TRUE THEN
118_grant_sanderson|BUT I THINK IF YOU CHOOSE A FEW CORS BUILDING BLOCKS ALONG THE WAY AND YOU SAY I'M REALLY GOING TO TRY TO
118_kate_darling|APPEARS TO BE
118_matt_botvinick|FOR ME PERSONALLY WOULD BE DISAPPOINTING I ONE UNDERSTAND HOW MENTAL ACTIVITY
118_peter_singer|I'M MORE SKEPTICAL ABOUT
118_richard_karp|THEVISUALIZATION WELL THE INTERPRETATION IN TERMS OF
118_russ_tedrake|BUT IT WAS A POINT AN MEAN IT MADE THE POINT
118_sheldon_solomon|I FEEL
119_ben_goertzel|THOUG H YOU MENTIONED THE STIASKIN NICER
119_dileep_george|FLYING MACHINES THAT DO NOT FLY AND ANINOHUMANS MIGHT NOT FLY FOR ANOTHER HUNDRED YEARS
119_grant_sanderson|APPROACH THIS UM
119_karl_friston|INHERITS A LOT FROM AM
119_matt_botvinick|ARISES FROM
119_sheldon_solomon|CONFIDENTLY
120_brian_kernighan|NOT JUST THE INITIAL BUDGESS
120_david_eagleman|PUT IT AT AGE ZERO ALREADY EQUIPPED TO DEAL WITH THE WORLD
120_david_patterson|AND SO THAT MEANT THEN IT DIDN'T REALLY MATTER A THE PROGRAMMER DIDN'T HAVE TO WRITE
120_dileep_george|THAT WAS WHAT THAT ARTICLE AR STATED AND A SO BUT NOW THERE THEY FLEW THREE YEARS AFTER THAT SO THES INO ITS VERY HARD TO A
120_françois_chollet|LIKE WE USE ACTUALLY SORT OF HUMAN INTERPRETABLE LANGUAGE BUT IS THERE SOMETHING LIKE A DEEPER
120_karl_friston|IS JUST A FORMAL STATEMENT THAT THE
120_manolis_kellis|LIKE A BIRD THAT'S BORN IN BOSTON WILL BE THE SAME AS BIRD AS BORN IN CALIFORNIA SO THERE'S NOT AS MUCH
120_matt_botvinick|NORL ACTIVITY
120_robert_langer|AGAINST VIL ANSWER
121_brian_kernighan|PROVIDE AN ENVIRONMENT THAT MADE IT EASY TO WRIT HER EASIER
121_david_eagleman|IN A LIKE HARD COATED WAY OR DO YOU PUT IT
121_joscha_bach|AND INTELLIGENCE IS EVADE TO GET TO THESE MODELS IF YOU DON'T ALREADY HAVE THEM
121_manolis_kellis|ARE INHERITANCE OF IDEAS OF CUSTOMS
121_richard_karp|AH BUT AGAIN IT
121_sara_seager|IS JUST A MATTER OF PERSPECTIVE BUT IT FEELS LIKE
121_sheldon_solomon|THE SCIENCES
122_ben_goertzel|HE'S CONE OF A RELIGIOUS FANATIC
122_jitendra_malik|BASICALLY A SINGLE NEL NUTWORK A MULTI TASK NEAL NUTWORK
122_richard_karp|I IDON'T HAVE THE HYDEMATIONAL INTUITION THAT WOULD PARTICULARLY INFORM ME SO I
122_sergey_levine|A SETS FOR IT
122_sheldon_solomon|LIKE A OU NON MIT MY FIELD OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE BUT ALSO PHYSICS
123_david_patterson|AND SO THAT THAT WAS THE DEBATE RIGHT IS A BECAUSE I PEOPLE WOULD ACKNOWLEDGE THAT
123_dileep_george|NORBORD DE BRAIN AND HOW THAT CAN BE USED TO BUILD
123_françois_chollet|LANGUAGE DO YOU THINK
123_jitendra_malik|TTHEY CALL IT HYDRONET MULTMULTIPLE HEADS SO DOES MULTIPLE TASK BUT IS FORMING THE SAME REPRESENTATION AT THE CORPS
123_matt_botvinick|WITHOUT ANY SENSE OF
123_peter_singer|IT MAY BRING PEOPLE CLOSE TOGETHER BUT
123_richard_karp|SORT OF DEEPEN LEAN ON THE ALGEBRE
123_russ_tedrake|I THINK IT GETS A BAD RAP ASAMO IS A BEAUTIFUL MACHINE IT DOES WALK WITH ITS KNEES BENT OUR ATLAS WALKING HAD ITS KNEES BENT
123_sergey_levine|BUT I THINK THAT THERE IS A SECOND ANSWER
123_sheldon_solomon|YOU KNOW IT IT OFTEN FEELS LIKE MAN WE DON'T REALLY UNDERSTAND MOST OF WHAT'S GOING ON HERE
123_steven_pressfield|COMES MMUSIC AND ART
124_dileep_george|A A MODALS WHICH CAN THEN GO BACK AND INFORM OF THE BRAIN WORKS OR SO MY WAY OF UNDERSTANDING THE BRAIN WOULD BE DUBIOUSLY SAY
124_françois_chollet|ECAUSE ITS SOMETHING DEEPER THAN LIKE THE SYNTACTIC RULES WE CONSTRUCT IS THERE SOMETHING THAT
124_grant_sanderson|SO THAT ASPECT ALSO SLOWED FINEMEN DOWN IN A LOT OF RESPECTS I THINK THERE WAS A PERIOD WINDMI
124_joscha_bach|ANSWER THE QUESTION THOUG WE JUST SAID WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ANSWER AND MAGHT BE A RECURSE OF METAL QUESTION OF WHAT IS INTELLIGENCE
124_peter_singer|THERE AR E OTHERWISE OF
124_richard_karp|TO LINGER ON THAT POINT WHAT KIND OF VISUALIZATION
124_robert_langer|THE HOW MUCH MYSTERY IS THERE ABOUT THE WHOLE THING HOW MUCH JUST BLIND EXPERIMENTATION
124_sara_seager|E JUST LIKE WAU THIS IS TERRIFYING WHAT'S OUT THERE
124_sheldon_solomon|ND CERTAINLY THAT'S TRUE WITH A
124_steven_pressfield|MORE AND MORE DESIRE TO CREATE
125_ben_goertzel|WHICH DUTH DOESN'T REALLY WORK SO ON THE ONE HAND
125_brian_kernighan|AND YOU WERE PART OF THAT COMMUNITY OF PROGRAMMERS
125_david_eagleman|AND THEN WHAT WE ALSO COME EQUIPPED WITH IS THE ABILITY TO ABSORB LANGUAGE AND CULTURE AND BELIEFS IN SONG
125_françois_chollet|DOESN'T REQUIRE
125_jitendra_malik|IN THIS WAY TOO
125_karl_friston|YOU CAN ALWAYS INTERPRET ANYTHING THAT EXISTS
125_kate_darling|WE DRAW THESE NO ARBITRARY LINES ALL THE TIME
125_manolis_kellis|AT EVERY GENERATION ARE HORIZONTALLY TRANSMITTED
125_matt_botvinick|I TO ME FEELS LIKE AM AT BEST TROPING AROUND DA YOU KNOW AT RANDOM
125_russ_tedrake|BUT IT WASN'T ENERGY EFFICIENT
125_sheldon_solomon|WE KNOW A LOT MORE
126_ben_goertzel|I I DIDN'T REALLY AGREE WITH DOSKIEVSKY ON ON HIS SORT OF RELIGIOUS POINT OF VIEW ON  ON THE OTHER HAND
126_david_patterson|TO THE CODE THAT'S WRITTEN BY HUMAN THAT ITSAR ATLEAST TO ME AGAIN PERHAPS A DUMB
126_ian_hutchinson|DUTERIUM HAS A PROTON AND A NUTRON
126_jitendra_malik|A PURELY A VISION PROBLEM AND INSOLVED WITHINWITH LEARNING
126_manolis_kellis|AND THE HUGE AMOUNT OF TIME THAT WE SPAND IN EDUCATING OURSELVES
126_matt_botvinick|IS PSYCHOLOGY AND
126_peter_singer|AND CALTRENSAR
126_russ_tedrake|NEITHER WAS ATLAS WHEN WE WORKED ON ATLAS
126_sara_seager|THAT YOU YOUR A SCIENTIST AN EXAWORL CLASS SCIENTISTS PLANTER SCIENTIST ASTRONOMER
127_david_eagleman|THAT'S THE TRICK IS HOW DO YOU ENGINEER SOMETHING JUST ENOUGH THAT IT'S THEN A SPONGE THAT'S READY TO TAKE IN AND FILL IN THE BLANKS
127_ian_hutchinson|AND TRITIUM HAS A PROTONIN TWO NUTRONTS SO IT HAS TOTAL OF THREE NUCLEANTS IN THE NEW IN THE NUCLIUS
127_jitendra_malik|OR EVEN MORE SPECIFICALLY IN THE CURRENT APPROACH WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT WHAT TESTLA AUTOPOLITE TEAMIS DOING
127_matt_botvinick|TRY TO UNDERSTAND THE MECHANISMS AT THE LOWEST LEVEL BUT DO YOU THINK THAT'S NEEDED
127_peter_singer|COULD YOU TAKE A STEP BACK AN
127_sergey_levine|CAN BRING TO THE TABLE
127_sheldon_solomon|FOR KNOWLEDGE AND INSIGHT
128_ben_goertzel|HUMAN NATURE AND SERVE THE HUMAN MIND AND AN AN HEART AND AND SOUL
128_david_eagleman|HOW MUCH OF THE MALLUBILITY IS HARD WARE HOW MUCH IS SOFTER IS THAT USEFUL ON THE BRAIN SO LIKE WHAT IT WOULD WE TALKING ABOUT SO THERES LIKE
128_françois_chollet|LANGUAGE IS OR THINKING THAT ARE NOT MADE OF WORDS
128_ian_hutchinson|WELL TAKING LIGHT
128_matt_botvinick|AS REQUIRED TO UNDERSTAND HOW THE MINE WORKS
128_peter_singer|APOLOGESS OF IT'S RIDICULOUS QUESTION BUT WHAT IS SUFFERING
128_robert_langer|THE FUNDAMENTAL MECHANISMS BY WHICH ITS DDOING IT
128_sergey_levine|TO HELP US UNDERSTAND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
129_ben_goertzel|IT'S REALLY UNPARALLELED AND HE HE HAD AN AMAZING VIEW OF HOW HUMAN BEINGS YOU KNO CONSTRUCT TO WORLD
129_brian_kernighan|SO THERE WAS NO NEED FOR INERDEBT IT'S FASCINATED TO THINK ABOUT WHAT
129_dileep_george|FILLING THE MISSING PIECES THAT IN A BIOLOGY JUST GIVES YOU THE HINTS AND
129_joscha_bach|AND THE OTHER ONE IS IS THED
129_manolis_kellis|IN AN EXTREMELY MALLUABLE STATE OF YOUR BRAIN AND THE WIRING OF YOUR BRAIN FOR A LONG PERIOD OF YOUR LIFE
129_matt_botvinick|THAT'S AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE WHOLE
129_richard_karp|REPETITION OF SOME INNERLOOP
129_robert_langer|IT REALLY VARIES I THINK SOMETIMES PEOPLE DO KNOW THEM
129_sara_seager|SOON EVEN STARTING SOON HOW DO YO DEFINED SOON
129_steven_pressfield|E LEKIHEZ ECHOES OF
130_dileep_george|IN OR PHILLISIN THE REST OF THE
130_matt_botvinick|AH I WOULD BE THE LAST PERSON ON EARTH TO SUGGEST THAT
130_robert_langer|BECAUSE THEY'VE FIGURED OUT PATHWAYS IN WEST INTERFERE THEM WITH HEM
130_steven_pressfield|THE THE CREATIVE FORCE THAT MAKES
131_brian_kernighan|IT SEEMS SO MANY THAT THE PEOPLE BEING IN THE VICINITY OF EACH OTHER
131_dileep_george|THE PIECES OF THE PUZZILE AND THEN HE CAN GO AND
131_françois_chollet|HE EBA MOSLEA
131_grant_sanderson|DO YOU YO'RE SWIMMING
131_ian_hutchinson|REACTING THEM TOGETHER TO PRODUCE HEAVIER ELIMENTS
131_kate_darling|IT BASED ON ANY CRITERIA THAT WOULD ACTUALLY
131_peter_singer|SUFFERING IS A CONSCIOUS STITE
131_robert_langer|MIKES OF CERNDIPITUS DISCOVERY AND
132_dileep_george|CONNECT THAT BACK TO BIOLOGY AND SAY OKE NOW IT MAKES SENSE THAT THIS PART OF NEER DHE BRAIN IS
132_ian_hutchinson|TYPICALLY HELIUM
132_jitendra_malik|AH IN THE NINETEES THERE WERE PPROACHES FROM A CARNIGIMELLEN THERE WER APROACHES FROM ARTIMAT BURKLEY
132_joscha_bach|I THINK YOU CALLED WHICH IS THE REAL ONE WHICH CAN NEVER GET ACCESS TO
132_manolis_kellis|YOU KNOW ALL BETTER OFF LIKE WE BISKLY OUR BRAIN CONTINUES TO DEVELOP
132_matt_botvinick|PSYCHOLOGY IS A HUGELY IMPORTANT DISCIPLINE
132_peter_singer|A THERE CAN BE NO SUFFERING FOR A BEING WHO IS COMPLETELY UNCONSCIOUS A
132_russ_tedrake|AKE WHATEVER THE WORLD'S DOING TO YOU AND PUSH BACK
132_sheldon_solomon|IF WE LOOK AT THE TANTIALISTS
133_grant_sanderson|E SOMETIMES WON ALIKE
133_ian_hutchinson|ON CAPWITCHES
133_karl_friston|FROM SOME PERSPECTIVE A CLEAN ANSWER TH MAYBEKEN TALK ABOUT THAT OPTIMIZATION
133_kate_darling|THINK IN GENERAL PEOPLE
133_matt_botvinick|AND AND ONE THING THAT WARMS IN MY HEART IS THAT
133_sergey_levine|COMPUTER VISION PURELY DEFINE AN IMAGENET AND CUNT O THE BIGGER RABOTICSPRA
133_sheldon_solomon|OR EVEN LIKE A MODERN
133_steven_pressfield|USUALLY THOUSANDS OR MORE
134_ben_goertzel|INTERSECTIN WITH EACH OTHER AND THAT THAT WAS ONE OF THE MANY BEAUTIFUL THINGS IN INDUSTIEVSKY
134_david_eagleman|EVERYTHING IS CHANGING THE RECEPTURE DISTRIBUTION INSIDE THAT NERON SO THAT UARE MORE OR LESS SENSITIVE TO THE NARROW TRANSMITTER
134_ian_hutchinson|ELIUM IS A NUCLEUS WHICH HAS
134_joscha_bach|WHAT ONE USEFUL ONE ONE OF YOUR RECENT TALKS I LOOK AT CAN YOU JUST DESCRIBE THE BASICS CAN YOU TALK ABOUT
134_karl_friston|THE MATHS FROM NON EQUILIBERANT STUDY STATE PHYSICS THAT T
134_kate_darling|A MOST PEOPLE ARE GOOD
134_manolis_kellis|TILL VERY LATE AND THIS IS WHAT ALLOWS EDUCATION
134_richard_karp|THE MECHANICS OF THE ALGRITHM IS OFTEN VERY SIMPLE
134_sergey_levine|SO THERE ARE COUPLE OF THINGS ONE IS THAT WITH ROBATICS A
134_sheldon_solomon|ANDWE WER
135_ben_goertzel|MY ANCESTRY
135_brian_kernighan|IN EHORSCOD FORM
135_david_patterson|PLACES THE BRD THESE RADICALS THAT ADVOCATED FOR THIS AGAINST THE RESTO COMMUNIO WERE I BE M BERKLEY AND STAMFORD
135_dileep_george|AND THEN CONTINUES EFFETIVELY
135_ian_hutchinson|PROTONS AND TWO NUTRONTS
135_jitendra_malik|OTONOMUS DRIVING  IN CERTAIN SETTINGS IS REARY DUABLE
135_matt_botvinick|WAYS OF INVESTIGATING BEHAVIOR THAT
135_peter_singer|IF WE HAVE EXPERIENCED IT IN THE PAST
135_richard_karp|M BUT ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU ARE TRYING SOMETHING OUT ON THE COMPUTER SO FOR EXAMPLE AM
135_robert_langer|IF YOU STEP BACK AS AN AMAZING TO YOU THAT
135_steven_pressfield|AH THAT YOU WOULD BE WILLING TO RISK YOUR IN LIFE
136_ben_goertzel|THREE QUARTERS EASTERN EUROPEAN A
136_david_eagleman|THE REASON THAT MOST PEOPLE ONLY TALK ABOUT THE SONAPTIC WEIGHTS IS BECAUSE THAT'S REALLY ALL WE CAN MEASURE WELL
136_françois_chollet|THAT AS THE BUILDING
136_ian_hutchinson|THAT ALSO RELEASES ENERGY AND THAT AND THAT OR REACTIONS LIKE THAT

147_sergey_levine|IN OUR INTUITION ABOUT IT
148_ben_goertzel|PH DEEN IN
148_david_eagleman|AN SO THIS IS  THINK THE WAY WE HAVE TO THINK ABOUT THE BRAIN
148_david_patterson|INSTRUCTIONS TETS A VOCABRULARY
148_françois_chollet|YOU MEAN LIKE CUT IN CONCEPT SPACE
148_joscha_bach|GEGETETO AH
148_matt_botvinick|THERE WAS STILL A THRILL
148_sergey_levine|WHY DO YOU THINK MANIPULATING OBJECTS AR SO HARD FROM EVERYTHING YOU'VE LEARNED FROM APPLYING MENFORCE LEARNING IN THE SPACE
149_ben_goertzel|PSYCHOLOGY WHO
149_brian_kernighan|AND SOME OF THAT IS
149_françois_chollet|VISUALLY YOUR EMBETTING IDEAS INTO SOMEINTO THREE TO MENTUAL SPACE YOU EXPLORE WITH YOUR MIND ESSENTIALLY
149_joscha_bach|LEM ME A LEMI MITE MY INFORMATION PROCESSING I A TI TI TAKE THAT IN
149_manolis_kellis|THAT THIS NEW
149_matt_botvinick|THAT THERE WERE WAYS OF
149_peter_singer|ITHAT TO A TO KEEP THINGS INTERESTING IN THE WORLD
149_sara_seager|THINGS HAVE TO COME TOGETHER SOMEWHERE SOME PLACE IN OUR UNIVERSE ITSO AMAZING TO THINK THAT SOMEBODY MIGHT BE LOOKING UP ON ANOTHER PLANET
149_sheldon_solomon|KNO THEY EXIST AS MUCH AS THEY SHOULD AND SO MUCH ECAUSE MOST PEOPLE A KIND OF
150_ben_goertzel|HAD THE UNENVIABLE JOB OF GIVING SUCCOTHERAPY TO THE JAPANESE AND
150_david_patterson|AND AMAZINGLY AS THEY HAD THEIR CHIPS
150_ian_hutchinson|A SOD AND THEYRE POSITIVELY CHARGED SO THEY THEY LIKE CHARGES REPEL EVERY ONE KNOWS THAT RIGHT SO
150_karl_friston|AH SO WHAT SPECIAL PROPERTIES
150_kate_darling|ASKING THEM OR TELLING THEM TO BE NICE TO THE SMAR SPEAKERS TO ALEXA
150_peter_singer|OTHERWISE HARMONIOUS AND BEAUTIFUL COMPOSITION AND THAT ISGUNNER ALWAYS BE THERE
150_richard_karp|OR IS THE INE
150_russ_tedrake|S A LOT IT TAKES IMPATIENCE THERE'S NO QUESTION
150_sheldon_solomon|IT'S INTERESTING THAT HUGH I DON'T ACUSE THINKING FROM A MONEY PERSPECTIVE
151_brian_kernighan|OND MORE FORMAL VIEW OF IT A SAME THING FOR DATA STRUCTURES
151_david_patterson|THEY COULD USE AND THEY COULD STILL BE COMPATIBLE WITH THIS A
151_grant_sanderson|LIKE HAVING A DECENTLY DEEP UNDERSTANDING OF A WIDE VARIETY OF THINGS
151_jitendra_malik|OF THE ACTORS IN THE SCENE
151_manolis_kellis|AND DEMOCAIZATION OF KNOWLEDGE ON ON AR
151_matt_botvinick|A THAT PROVIDED INSIGHT TO THE STRUCTURE OF THE MIND
151_sheldon_solomon|WOULD BE OF
152_ben_goertzel|EASTERN EUROPIN
152_david_patterson|I  IN THI PIECE ERA
152_grant_sanderson|MOST PEOPLE WHO ARE
152_jitendra_malik|AND PREDICT THEIR BEHAVIOR
152_joscha_bach|YAGOITL IS REAL
152_kate_darling|ECASE DEATH THAT STORYSTHE IDEA OF PRACTICING EMPATHY
152_peter_singer|WE WOULD BE BETTER OFF OR WEATHER IN TERMS OF BI OLIMINATING THE SUFFERING WE WOULD ALSO ELIMINATE SOME OF THE HIGES
152_russ_tedrake|SAID THAT THE ANSWER IS TO DO WITH THAT WITH CONTROL
152_sergey_levine|THE NOTION OF
153_brian_kernighan|FIELD AS WELL AN ENGINEER IS NOT QUITE THE SAME AS SCIENCE BECAUSE ENGINEERING YOURE WORKING WITH CONSTRAINTS YOU HAVE TO A
153_dileep_george|USING HINTS FROM YOUR SIENSE  AND REPEAT TE CYCLE
153_grant_sanderson|NO COMPUTER SCIENCE REALLY DEEPLY
153_joscha_bach|IN ANY OF THE SO LIKE THERE'S A AGAIN THESE TERMS ARE
153_matt_botvinick|AT THAT STAGE AND MY EDUCATION WAS
153_richard_karp|AT A CERTAIN
153_sheldon_solomon|EN AGAIN I WISH HE WAS HERE TO CORRECT ME IF O WHEN I SAY THAT
154_david_eagleman|I MEAN OF COURSE SOFT WEAR
154_david_patterson|THE TIME OF DESIGNING RISK
154_dileep_george|I GUESS THE DREAMEST TO BOTH UNDERSTAND THE BRAIN AND TO BUILD AG EI SYSTEMS SO YOU'RE IT'S LIKE AN ANGIN YEARS
154_françois_chollet|YOU'RE ABLE TO MOVE INSIDE YOUR MIND AN YOU AN IF YOU'RE WRITING AND LIKE YOU PAPER FRENCANSE DON'T YOU I MELICT A SPECIAL REPRESENTATION OF YOUR PAPER
154_ian_hutchinson|AND YOU HAVE TO GET THEM EXTREMELY CLOSE TO ONE ANOTHER
154_jitendra_malik|AND BUILDING PREDICTIVE MODERS OF OTHER AGENTS IN THE WORLD
154_karl_friston|SO THE THE FENAGY PRINCIPLE SAYS THAT IF SOMETHING EXISTS THESE ARE THE PROPERTIES IT SHOULD DISPLAY
154_kate_darling|IL ALWAYS HAVE A PRETTY GOOD DETECTIVE FOR PLEASE
154_manolis_kellis|A WITH THIS DEMOCRATISATION COMES THE ABOLISHMENT OF RESPECTING EXPERTEES
154_matt_botvinick|NNEURVOS PSYCHOLOGLOON AT
154_robert_langer|THE SOME OF IT IS A JUST THE SHRINKING OF THE TEGNOOGY
154_russ_tedrake|ISN'T THE WAY WE SHOULD
154_sheldon_solomon|HE IS MORE COMMITTED
154_steven_pressfield|TERRIBLE TENSION WITHIN THAT AND
155_ben_goertzel|BUNCH OF MEAT MUSIC MUSIC AND THEYARE ALSO AN CLEARLY
155_brian_kernighan|CALL IT A FEW HUNDRED LINES OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT ATD SPEEN A LONG TIME SINCE I ROTE PERHAMS THAT WERE MUCH MORE THAN THAT
155_david_eagleman|OUT OF THE CITY
155_jitendra_malik|WHICH COULD BE OTHER AGENTS COULD BE PEOPLE THOU THE AGENTS COULD BE OTHER CAUSE THAT IS PART OF THE TASCO PERCEPTION
155_joscha_bach|AND IS COMPLETELY FUNDAMENTALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO GET ACESS TO IT BECAUSE I
155_manolis_kellis|JUST BECAUSE YOU SPENT YOU KNOW TEN THOUSAND HOURS OF YOUR LIFE STUDYING BOT AN OLD HUMAN D
155_matt_botvinick|LOOKING AT THE ANALYZING THE BEHAVIOR OF POPULATIONS WHO HAD ON
155_peter_singer|A MINIMUM OF SUFFERING IN ORDER TO HAVE
155_richard_karp|TELETHE GAP
155_sheldon_solomon|UT TWO
155_steven_pressfield|AND WHICH CREATES
156_david_eagleman|THE SIGG MATTER FI MEAN
156_ian_hutchinson|SO THAT'S WHY YE CAN DO LIKE THAT IN THE SUN SO WE CAN BUILD TE SUN
156_jitendra_malik|BECAUSE THAT PERCEPTION ALWAYS HAS TO
156_joscha_bach|ISN'T THE STORY SUPPOSE TO ISN'T THE BRAIN IN A IN IN SOMETHING
156_richard_karp|FROM THE OPTIMEN
156_russ_tedrake|IN THE MOVEMENT OF ANY I DO HI AN FAVORITE EXAMPLE OKA
156_sara_seager|IT HAS TO BE A STAR
156_steven_pressfield|A WAR INSIDE OURSELVES SO THE OUTER THE OUTER WAR WHEN I WHEN I THINK ABOUT
157_ben_goertzel|LEARNING  AND AND
157_david_patterson|THINK LIKE A MICHOPROCESSOR GINIER
157_dileep_george|AM SOVICION WISHALL GOTEXISNOJEST EH
157_françois_chollet|CANAFLICA SAWUEMAP
157_grant_sanderson|I DO THINK I COULD MAKE NEW LIKE EXPOSITIONAL CONTRIBUTIONS WHERE THERE'S CAND OF A NOTION OF
157_jitendra_malik|NOT TELL US WHAT IS NOW BUT WHAT WILL HAPPEN
157_joscha_bach|IN A EXISTING IN SOME KIND OF CONTAXT BUT WHAT WE CAN IDENTIFY AS COMPUTE AS SCIENTISTS WE CAN
157_karl_friston|INTERESTING CHERAVAN DISTINCTION DISTINCTIONABLE YE I I THINK THERE IS AM SO AM
157_russ_tedrake|
157_sara_seager|QUITE CLOSE TO EARTH LAY
158_david_eagleman|IT'S HARD TO KNOW WHAT TO DO I THINK ABOUT THAT LIKE IF I WERE TO ASK THE QUESTION
158_david_patterson|YOU THINK LIKE AH
158_dileep_george|FEEDFORWARD GASCADE OFF NURONCE UM
158_grant_sanderson|AH THINGS THAT ARE KNOWN BUT LIKE HAVEN'T BEEN EXPLAINED VERY WELL
158_ian_hutchinson|HOW DO YOU CREATE A FUSION R EN  AT REACTION YE
158_karl_friston|FOUR KINDS OF STATES IN ANY GIVEN UNIVERS THAT CONTAINS ANYTHING THE THINGS ARE INTERNAL
158_kate_darling|THAT'S TRUE WHETHER IT'S AN OUTLET FOR PEOPLE OR WHETHER IT JUST KIND OF AMY FRIEND ONE SAID TRAINS THEIR CRUELTY MUSCLES AND MAKES THEM MORE CRUEL IN OTHER SITUATIONS
158_manolis_kellis|BUT WE HAVE TO TEACH THEM THE MEANS TO GET TO KNOWLEDGE
158_peter_singer|WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT ERADICATING POVERTY IN THE WORLD
158_richard_karp|AND DAM
158_sheldon_solomon|OUGHT TO FIND MEANING AND VALUE IN LIFE
159_ben_goertzel|ALTHOUGH THE WHOLE IDEA IN THE
159_david_eagleman|AH THIS IS IMPORTANT QUESTION FOR MAS SHE LEARNING IS A HOW DOES THE BRAIN LEARN
159_ian_hutchinson|WHERE THEY RELEASE MORE
159_kate_darling|A BOY YEAH AND THAT EXPANSE TO OTHER TOPICS ATWHICH I I DON'T NOTE YOU KNOW THERE'S A I
159_matt_botvinick|ALLESION IN A PARTICULAR PART OF THE BRAIN AND THE THE KIND OF EXPERIMENTATION THAT WAS DONE IN THAT STILL BEING DONE
159_richard_karp|VARIOUS METRICS OF WHAT'S GOING ON ARE IMPROVING ALL ALONG UNTIL E FINALLY HIT THE OPTIMUM
160_ben_goertzel|LIKE THE JEWS THAT THE CHOSEN PEOPLE OF GOD NEVER RESINATED WITH ME TUMONC
160_brian_kernighan|WHY DO YOU THINK IT'S SUCH A POWERFUL TOOL GRAP ANOK WHY DO YOU THINK I'LL BRATING SYSTEMS LIKE WINDOWS FOR EXAMPLE DON'T
160_david_eagleman|ADO YOU NOT HAV TA SERF
160_françois_chollet|AS I THERE'S A KEY
160_grant_sanderson|HAT YOURE CREATING SOMETHING NEW
160_jitendra_malik|I MEAN NOW
160_joscha_bach|YOU'VE SAID ON THIS TOPIC YOUVE SAID IN A RECENT CONVERSATION THAT QUOTE
160_karl_friston|WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT
160_matt_botvinick|TOGET ANSWERS
160_robert_langer|COMPUTING SYSTEMS HAVING A ROLE
160_sara_seager|HUNDREDS OF LIGHT YEARS LAK HOW MANY STARS ARE CLOSE BY
160_sergey_levine|WHAT THINGS ARE GOING TO DO INTO THE FUTURE IN ORDER FOR YOU TO BE ABLE TO UM ACT IN THAT WORLD AND THEN THEREIS ALSO THE
160_sheldon_solomon|HIS WHAT'S HIS WORM AT THE CORPS
161_joscha_bach|SOME PEOPLE THINK THAT A SIMULATION CAN'T BE CONSCIOUS AND ONLY I PHYSICAL SYSTEM CAN BUT THEY GOT IT COMPLETELY BACKWARD AF PHYSICAL SYSTEM
161_karl_friston|IN TERNAL STRATES
161_kate_darling|TOUCHED AT ALL RESEARTWISE
161_robert_langer|IN THE ANY PART OF THIS INTO THE THE DELIVERY DRUGS TO THE DESIGN OF DRUGS IN ANY PART OF THE CHAINE
161_steven_pressfield|MOUNTAIN MEN
162_david_eagleman|U WHAT HAPPENS IS YOU KNOW YOU'LL BE TERRIBLE AT FIRST YOU KNOW HOW I PRET YOUR BODY NOT HOW TO READ THE WAVES THINGS LIKE THAT
162_dileep_george|AH LEVELITI
162_françois_chollet|AND A LOT OF IT ISN'T IN THE FOG
162_grant_sanderson|OF THE VERY THING
162_sheldon_solomon|YOU KNOW FROM A DISTANCE
162_steven_pressfield|AND BASICLY
163_david_patterson|EASY IT WILL BE FOR COMPALLERS
163_françois_chollet|AYOU ARE TRYING TO KIND OF IT'S ALMOST LIKE O
163_jitendra_malik|MAYBE THE SYSTEM SIX MONTHS FROM NOW WE'LL NOT HAVE THAT THAT
163_kate_darling|SERVE ANY KIND OF INTERACTION BETWEEN HUMAN ROBUTAS
163_richard_karp|DON CANUTH
163_robert_langer|IF YOU GET A LARGE AMOUNT OF INFORMATION NEED I'LL SAY YOU HAVE SOME CHEMICAL DAT CAUSE YOU'VE DONE HI THROUH PUT SCREENS
163_steven_pressfield|BARBARIANS
164_françois_chollet|FROM BOTH SIDES AN YE SEE WHERE WE ARE TO JOIN
164_jitendra_malik|THAT PARTICULAR FALURE MODE
164_kate_darling|SHOWS ANY KIND OF COMPASSION THEY IMMEDIATELY THINK FROM A PRODUCT RERSPECTIVE IN E YEAR TERM
164_manolis_kellis|THIS HUGE WEALTH OF KNOWLEDGE SO YOU NEED A BASIC EDUCATIONAL FOUNDATION
164_peter_singer|AN OBJECTIVE LEVEL OF SUFFERING
164_richard_karp|HAS CALLED ATTENTION TO A BREED OF PEOPLE WHO WIL DERIVE GREAT AESTHETIC
164_steven_pressfield|MACEDONIANS
165_david_patterson|THAT EVERYTHING IN THERE CAN BE USED BY COMPILERS
165_françois_chollet|START PROVING FROM THAT
165_grant_sanderson|SO MAYBE THAT'S WHAT GOES ON EVERY RESEARCHER IS JUST ON THE OTHER END OF THAT HUMP AND IT FEELS LIKE IT SO FAR AWAY BUT ONE STEP
165_ian_hutchinson|THAT'S NOT THE REASON THEY DID IT FIZZLED OUT IS THAT YES THEY WERE BURNING THEY THEREWAS SMOKE COMING FROM THEM BUT THEY WERE NOT IGNITED
165_karl_friston|NOW WE MADE THE NEXT MOVE
165_peter_singer|OR OF POVERTY WHERE
165_robert_langer|AND THEN MAYBE USED THAT SOMEHOW TO PREDICT THE NEXT GENERATION OF THINGS THAT YOU WOULD TEST
165_steven_pressfield|CREAT BY CREATING THIS ARMY AND THIS DREAM
166_ben_goertzel|PROFESSOR HE KNEW THAT AT YU PEN NEARBY WHO WHO UNDERSTOOD THESE THINGS RIGHT SO THAT'S
166_david_patterson|THINGS THAT ARE MISSING AH THAT'LL MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR THE PROGRAMME TO RUN
166_dileep_george|AND MEN YOU GO AND READ THE LITERATURE YES PEOPLE HAVE PROBED IT AND PEOPLE HAVE PROBED IT VERY SYSTEMATICALLY AN AN THEY HAVE HYPOTHESIS ABOUT HOU
166_françois_chollet|FROM THE DESTINATION
166_joscha_bach|AND ASO THESE PRAYERS THAT YOU COMMIT TO ARE LARGERLY
166_karl_friston|BUT WHAT ABOUT LIVING THINGS
166_manolis_kellis|ADON THE SORT OF DOMAIN SPECIFIC KNOWLEDGE
166_richard_karp|SO IN THE ASSINING PROBLEM YOU HAVE E
166_sergey_levine|OPITIMATLY TO BEST ACCOMPLISH THE TASK
166_sheldon_solomon|RIGHT NOW FOR WHICH THERE IS MORE EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE AND SO I APPRECIATED THAT HE'S GREAT
166_steven_pressfield|OF CONQUERING THE WORLD
167_david_patterson|ITHINK FROM HENNESEASON MY PERSPECTIVE IN THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES WHAT HAPPENED WAS GOING FROM KIND OF REALLY A R
167_dileep_george|THOSE LATAL CONNECTIONS ARE
167_grant_sanderson|HIS LECTURES AR WHILE HE READING HIS LECTURES EVERYTHING MAKES SUCH PERFECT SENSE
167_ian_hutchinson|OR WHAT WE NEED TO DO
167_joscha_bach|TARGED VALUES THAT OUR NEEDS SHOULD APPROACH SET POINTS
167_karl_friston|I MEAN SO LET ME ASK YOU WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN AN OIL DROP AND A LITTLE TADPOLE OR A LITTLE LAVA
167_matt_botvinick|THE COST OF DOING
167_peter_singer|YOU'RE CONSTANTLY HUNGRY HAM
167_richard_karp|IN BOYS AND IN GIRLS
168_brian_kernighan|ROB'S EXPERIENCE WITH ET HE
168_dileep_george|POSSITLY CONTRIBUTING DO WE SHALL PROSS A THING
168_grant_sanderson|SO AS AN ENTERTAINMENT
168_ian_hutchinson|WHAT THE STARS DO IN ORDER TO GENERATE NUCLIA
168_manolis_kellis|BUT IT SHOULD ALSO BE
168_matt_botvinick|HIGHLY CONTROLLED EXPERIMENTS
168_richard_karp|IN YOU ARE GIVEN THE DESIRABILITY OF A OR OR THE COST
168_robert_langer|AND PERHAPS I APOLOGIZE AS ISIS A PHILOSOPHICAL BROADER QUESTION BUT DO WE OVERRELY IN THEM DO WE IMPROPERLY PRESCRIBE THE
168_russ_tedrake|THAT HAD THE SAME SORT OF VORTEX STREET
168_sergey_levine|TOWARDS HUMAN LEVEL INTELLIGENCE
168_sheldon_solomon|T'S ONE OF THE
169_brian_kernighan|ENVY I ALDI
169_kate_darling|HEN I'M TRYING TO SAY THEY THEY WON'T
169_manolis_kellis|THE WAY TO ACQUIRE KNOWLEDGE
169_matt_botvinick|IS THAT YOU BY CONSTRUCTION MISS OUT ON
169_richard_karp|THE EITHE BOY WITH THE JASE GIRL FOR ALL IENCHEE YOU'RE GIVEN A MATRIX OF NUMBERS
170_ben_goertzel|FAH AND KIRK HAD TRICKED INTO A MECHANICAL BRIKDUM BY PRESENTING WITH A LOGICAL PARADOX
170_david_eagleman|IT REMAINS VALUABLE YOUR WHOLE LIFESO EVEN WHEN YOUR OLLD PERSO YOU'LL BE ABLE TO
170_françois_chollet|PEOPLE THAT SEEMED TO LIKE
170_grant_sanderson|YOU KNOW EVEN A WEEK LATER
170_ian_hutchinson|ENOUGH ENERGY TO KEEP THEMSELVES HOT
170_karl_friston|THE ODROP WILL BE MOVED  BUT DOES IT IN AN OF ITSELF MOVE AUTONIMOUSLY
170_manolis_kellis|ANY OF US KNOW HOW TO DO THAT IN THIS MODERN DAY WERD I ECT YU LEARNING ONE W THE BIG SURPRISING THING TO ME ABOUT THE
170_matt_botvinick|THE RICHNESS AND COMPLEXITY OF THE REAL WORLD ONE THING THAT SO  I I WAS DRAWN INTO SCIENCE BY
170_richard_karp|AND YOU WANT TO
170_russ_tedrake|AND THEY PUT A REAL FISH
170_sergey_levine|KIND OF US TO DO WITH THEM
171_ben_goertzel|AND I WAS JUST LIKE ONE THIS MAKES NO SENSE THIS A I IS VERY VERY SMART 'S BEEN TRAVELLING ALL AROUND THE UNIVERSE Y

171_sara_seager|THE GOLDY LOCKSTONE OF THE HOSTAR
172_ben_goertzel|BUT THESE PEOPLE COULD TRICK IT WITH A SIMPLE LOGICAL PARADOX LIKE WHY
172_david_eagleman|REALLY YOUR GOAL IS TO MAKE AN INTERNAL MODEL OF THE WORLYOUR GOAL IS TO SAY
172_david_patterson|WHAT ARE THE METRICS THAT YOU ARE THINKING ABOUT WHEN LOOKING AT THESE STRAYE OFFS NOW LLET'S TALK ABOUT THEMETRICS SO
172_françois_chollet|CALLAC TE MEDICINE SIDE YOUR MIND
172_grant_sanderson|AM SO
172_joscha_bach|THE YOU KIND OF DESCRIBED ING SORT OF THIS EMERGENT PHENOMENA OF CONSCIOUSNESS FROM THE STIMULATION
172_matt_botvinick|WHAT WE NOW CALL DEEP LEARNING ON AND AT THAT POINT IN HISTORY
172_robert_langer|CAN WE TALK ABOUT ANOTHER EXCITING
172_russ_tedrake|AND THE AMAZING THING IS THAT IF YOU WATCH FROM ABOVE
172_sergey_levine|AH IT'S IT'S HARD TO JUST SAY LIKE OH IF YOU CAN LATERNOLIC

173_sara_seager|L THE STARS OUT THERE EVEN  VERY NEAREST ARE
173_sheldon_solomon|AND AUTONOMY
174_françois_chollet|AS A AS CAN AFFLACT A CONSEQUENCE OF A ORGANIZING THINGS ON PAPERALY STALL BEING MO ORGANIZED AND SEDYOU INSIDE YOUR ON MIND WHAT WHAT IS THAT WORK LIKE YOU PUT
174_joscha_bach|DOES I STILL FEEL
174_manolis_kellis|MAY BE ANY ONE PARTICULAR O
174_matt_botvinick|PRIMARILY BEING USED IN ORDER TO MODEL HUMAN COGNITION AN THEY WEREN'T YET REALLY USEFUL FOR INDUSTRIAL APPLICATIONS
174_richard_karp|HETHE BEST WAY TO MATCH THE BOYS WITH THE GIRLS OR
174_sheldon_solomon|TWO INDIVIDUALS
175_david_patterson|RIGHT
175_françois_chollet|LIKE YOU HAVE AN EXAMPLE A WHATT WIDIT WIDY WHAT'S THE FIRST THING YOU WRITE ON PAPER WHAT'S THE SECOND THING YOU WRITE
175_ian_hutchinson|TENS OF MILLIONS OF DEGREE CELSIUS
175_joscha_bach|LIKE II UNDERSTAND YOCANA THISSELF IS AN IMTPORTANT PART OF THE STIMULATION
175_karl_friston|SO THERE ARE TWO TYPES OF OIL DROPS IF YOU LIKE THERE ARE OIL DROPS WHERE THE INTERNAL STATES ARE SO AMB
175_kate_darling|AM YOU KNOW EVEN PROSTITUTION LIKE THEIR PROSTITUTES THAT SPECIALIZE IN
175_manolis_kellis|WITH JUST
175_matt_botvinick|FROM FROM THE EIGHTIES SOME WHEN I WAS N WENT TO MEDICAL SCULL BEFORE I WENT INTO SCIENCE
175_peter_singer|A THAT CAN HAPPEN AND THAT THEN IS A KIND OF A RELATIVE SUFFERING
175_robert_langer|ORGANS  AND A CHIP THE SOUNDS FASCINATING SO WOULD
175_russ_tedrake|FISH HAS A CHARACTERISTIC GAIT
175_steven_pressfield|YOU KNOW I GET INVITED TO SPEAK TO RENCOR GROUPS AND THINGS LIKE THAT ALL THE TIME AND I DECLINE
176_brian_kernighan|RELATIVELY CRUDE ASSEMBLY LANGUAGES WHERE PEOPLE WOULD
176_david_eagleman|YOU'RE ESSENTIALLY ON YOUR OWN PLANET IN THERE AND I'M ESSENTIALLY ON MY OWN PLAN ATD EVERY ONE'S GOT THEIR OWN
176_dileep_george|A IN A MALTIPLE LAYERS
176_ian_hutchinson|IN ORDER FOR THE REACTIONS TO GO FAST ENOUGH TO GENERATE ENOUGH ELECTRICITY TO KEEP
176_jitendra_malik|HAL FOR LEARNING THE SAMCAPABILITIES SO SAY THAT THERE IS GOING TO BE A SISTENT THAT SALLS THE TIME AS DRIVING
176_kate_darling|YET I THINK THAT'S AN EXCITING
176_manolis_kellis|ARE ANCREDIBLY GOOD AT AGGREGATING DATA AND PLOTTING AN VISUALIZING THAT DATA THAT'S BEEN REALLY SURPRISING TO ME I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO MAKE OF IT
176_peter_singer|DISTINCT FROM THE OBJECTIVE FORMS OF SUFFERING
177_ben_goertzel|HE WASN'T HE WASN'T GETTING TO SAY ANYTHING ONE WAY OR THE OTHER BUT YOU KNOW I
177_brian_kernighan|IN THEIR SIMPLEST FORM AT LEAST ONE INSTRUCTION PUR OR ONE ASSEMBLY LANGUAGE INSTRUCTION PUR INSTRUCTION IN THE MACHINES REPRTOISE
177_david_eagleman|AND WE'VE GOT THIS VERY THIN BANDWIDTH OF COMMUNICATION
177_david_patterson|AUNT ANEVERIGE SO YOU'D MULTIPLY
177_dileep_george|AND IT OUR COLUMNOSTRUCTURE
177_françois_chollet|ABOUT THE TOPICS HE WOULD START BY
177_grant_sanderson|THE VERY SAME THING THAT SO ADMIRABLE ABOUT FINEMAN'S LECTURES WHICH IS HOW
177_ian_hutchinson|OR ENOUGH ENERGY TOKEEP IT GOING
177_jitendra_malik|O YOU THINK IT WILL LOOK SIMILAR TO WHAT WE HAVE TO DAY
177_karl_friston|WHEN YE DO THE AVERAGING MOVE SO A NICE EXAMPLE OF THAT WILL BE THE SUN
177_manolis_kellis|AM I DON'T KNOW
177_peter_singer|BUT IN YOUR FOCUS ON ERADICATING SUFFERING YOU DON'T THINK ABOUT THAT KIND OF
177_sara_seager|WA YOU DON'T
177_sheldon_solomon|AND IN A PERFECT UNIVERSE
178_richard_karp|IF THERE IS A CONNECTION THAT IS NOT ALLOWED THEN YOU CAN THINK OF IT IS HAVING AN INFINITE COT A
178_russ_tedrake|HERE WAS THE EXPERIMENT THAT REALLY WAS THE CLINCHER CAUSE I WAS STILL IT WASN'T CLEAR HOW MUCH THAT WAS MECHANICS OF THE FISH HOW MUCH THAT IS CONTROL
178_sara_seager|WHAT DA WHAT IS HOW TO SIZE COMIN TO PLAY
178_sergey_levine|PROBLEMS IN WHICH IT'S EASY TO A
178_sheldon_solomon|ERE WOULDN'T BE ANY SOCIETIES
178_steven_pressfield|IT'S NOT THAT'S NOT WHAT'S INTERESTING
179_david_patterson|AND THAT ETS YOU HE TIME O CASE SO THAT'S BONOTILIST LOOK AT THIS A METRIC OF HOW LONG THEY TAKE THE INSTRUCTION TO RUN WILE TURNS DOWN
179_françois_chollet|PROB IM SO OSY DE THAT
179_joscha_bach|BESLIMALTIMEDIA CONTENT AND IS THE BOTTLE OF WHAT THE PERSON WOULD FEEL IF IT EXISTED
179_sara_seager|OW DOS DEM
179_sergey_levine|YOU WILL GET A LOT OF MONEY IF YOU CAN DO IT WELL WHAT AS YOUR BODY GRASPING
179_steven_pressfield|ABOUT IT TO ME
180_ben_goertzel|HE LET IT PROTEST
180_david_patterson|SO IN THESE RISIS DEBATES WE WOULD
180_françois_chollet|EACHUST MENTIONED INTELLIGENCE IN LANGUAGE AND MOTION
180_jitendra_malik|NURALL NUTWORKS D' YOU THINK IT WILL LOOK SIMILAR
180_joscha_bach|SO IT'S A VIRTUAL PERSON
180_kate_darling|THE FULL LIKE PI LEAN EXPLORING THE FULL COMPLEXITY AND RICHNESS OF WHO YOU ARE
180_manolis_kellis|WHERE SHOULD YOU GO TO LEARN ABOUT THE
180_richard_karp|WHAT YOU DO IS A
180_robert_langer|O IS THEIR ANVASUS IS NOT A BAD WORD SAYS THERE POSSIBILY TO B
180_russ_tedrake|MANY GOOD EXPERIMENTS
180_steven_pressfield|BUT DIDN'T YOU JUST SAY
181_ben_goertzel|CALLED SLAM STUDENT LEAGUE AGAINST MORTALITY THEY WERE PROTESTING AGAINST DEATH AND WAT WAT WANT WANDERING ACROSS THE CAMPAS SO HE
181_brian_kernighan|EUNUCHS THE OPERATING SYSTEM ITSELF WAS PORTABLE AS WERE ALL THE TOOLS THAT ALL WERE
181_david_eagleman|IT MAY NOT BE THAT PLASTICITY IS DIMINISHING IT MAY BE THAT THEIR INTERNAL MODEL ESSENTIALLY
181_david_patterson|THEY WOULD CONCENTRATE ON BUT RISK NAKES NEEDS TO TAKE MORE INSTRUCTIONS
181_françois_chollet|OUTSTAR BECOMING PARINOID
181_grant_sanderson|WE'LL TALK ABOUT IT A LITTLE BIT I THINK WE YOU'VE DONE SOME INERACTIS STUFF AND M EVEN IN YOUR VIDIOS
181_karl_friston|ESSENTIALLY MOVING CHANGING ONE'S SHAPE A MORE PHOR GENESIS THAT IS DYNAMIC
181_kate_darling|CO ARE YOU REALLY
181_manolis_kellis|ABALCURON VIRUS
181_peter_singer|OBJECTIVE FORMS OF SUFFERING WHICH I THINK ARE ASE
181_richard_karp|TO DEPEND ON THE OBSERVATION
181_robert_langer|WEAVE INTO THES CANVEROUS A COMPUTATIONAL COMPONENT
182_jitendra_malik|A SCIENTIFIC HYPOTHESIS AS ON WHICH WAY IS IT GOING TO GO I WILL TELL YOU WHAT I WOULD BET ON SO
182_joscha_bach|BUT HELON A SECOND DO I EXIST
182_karl_friston|ANPOSSIBLY ADAPI
182_kate_darling|II JUST FEEL IN WERE COMPLEX
182_manolis_kellis|WHAT WOULD YOU SAY ITIS SUCH A BEAUTIFUL EXAMPLE AND I THINK OF THE CURRENT PENDAMIC AN THE THE SPEED AT WHICH THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY HAS MOVED
182_matt_botvinick|DOING SCIENTIFIC RESRCH THAT
182_peter_singer|GENERALLY MORE SEVERE AND ALSO PERHAPS EASIER OF THIS STAGE ANY WAY TO KNOW
182_richard_karp|THE IDENTITY OF THE
182_russ_tedrake|AND THEN THEY ASKED WHAT WOULD THAT DEAD FISH DO WHEN HITWAS HANGING OUT BEHIND THE ROCK
182_sara_seager|AND
182_steven_pressfield|IN VARIOUS WAYS WARRIORS
183_david_patterson|WHAT WHAT ARE THE INSTRUCTIONS IN THE RISK INSTRUCTION SAID JUST TO GET INTUITION
183_ian_hutchinson|CONFINING THE PLACE
183_joscha_bach|IN YOUR SIMULATION
183_karl_friston|ERDYLAMIC THAT'S GOING ON THAT DEPENDS UPON THIS DEEPLYST STRUCTURED AUTONOMOUS
183_robert_langer|SOMEABILITY TO SENSE CONTROL SOME ASPECT OF THIS GROWTH PROCESS FOR THE TISSUE
184_ben_goertzel|TEN YEARS AFTER THAT IS SOMETHING  I DISCOVERED
184_joscha_bach|LIGHT YOU DO EXIST IN A  ALMOST SIMILARL AS ME SO THER INTERNAL STATES THAT I A
184_karl_friston|ERM BEHAVIOR THE RESTS UPON
184_manolis_kellis|THE HORIZONTAL TRANSFER IN THE SPEED OF HORIZONTAL TRANSFER OF INFORMATION THE FACT THAT
185_ben_goertzel|DOUGLAS HOFFSTANDERS BOAT GORDEL ESHERBACH AND THAT WAS SORTOF TO THE SAME POINT OF
185_brian_kernighan|AND THERE WERE NO OTHER BOOKS ON SEA IT
185_joscha_bach|THAT ARE LESS ACCESSIBLE
185_karl_friston|INTERNAL DYNAMICS THAT ARE
185_manolis_kellis|ENO THE GINO WAS FIRST SEQUENCE
185_robert_langer|WORKING MOSTLY ON ONVALIDATING THESE CONSCIONT SHIPS FOR SANG WELL AT
185_sara_seager|REVAMPED IT FOR THIS NEW FIELD OF EXOPLANET ASTRONOMY
186_david_eagleman|UM I ASIN BUT IF YOU WERE EIGHTY AND YOU GOT FIRED FROM YOUR JOB AND SUDDENLY HAD TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO PROGRAME A WORD PRESS SIGHT OR SOMETHING HEU FIGURED OUT
186_grant_sanderson|I THINK THAT'S ALMOST A INEQUIVALENT OF
186_ian_hutchinson|S VERY WEAKK COMPARED
186_karl_friston|NOT ONLY MODELLING
186_manolis_kellis|IN ARLY GENUARY THE FIRST SAMPLE WAS OBTAINED DECEMBER TWENTY NINTH  NINETEENTH A WEEK AFTER THE PUBLICATION OF THE FIRST GENOBSEQUENCE
186_matt_botvinick|WHAT WHAT HAD ALWAYS FASCINATED ME
186_peter_singer|SORRY TO LINGER ON IT BECAUSE HE KIND HAVE SAID IT BUT JUST TO EM
186_robert_langer|O WHAT KIND OF TISSUES CAN WE JINEER TO DAY
186_sara_seager|HE'S HE ILIGRAD TOLD APPROVAL WHAT MAY A ACASU SIR NOT AER IF HE'D ACTUALLY READ THE SUFF ABOUT
186_steven_pressfield|IS ARACTE
187_brian_kernighan|AND I'M NOT SURE IT COMPLETELY SUCCEEDED BUT IT MOSTLY WORKED OUT FAIRLY WELL WATYTHING IS THE POWER OF EXAMPLE I MEAN YER
187_david_eagleman|IN THIS REGARD WHICH IS ADDING
187_dileep_george|A TIANGLE YOU UNDERSTAND WHERE THE CONTUSE OF THE TANGLE ARE
187_françois_chollet|AND I WILL START BECOMING PARINOIED OS NOT
187_karl_friston|THEY DATA IMPRESSED UPON THEIR SURFACE OR THE BLANKET STATES BUT THEY ARE
187_matt_botvinick|EVEN WHEN I WAS A PRETTY YOUNG KID I THINK
187_peter_singer|IS ELIMINATION THE GOAL FOR THE AFFLUENT SOCIETY SO
187_sara_seager|MY EQUATION BUT HE WAS CALL THAT HE WAS CO SCHOOLER I OHI SAW IT I JUST SAID LIKE FIFTEEN DIFFERENT THINGS BUT MAYBE
187_sergey_levine|IF YOU GET REALLY GOOD TO PICK ME UP BOXES AND NOW YOU HAVE TO PICK UP PLASTING BAGS IM
187_steven_pressfield|NAMED TELAMON WHOSE ACTUAL ITS THE LONG STORY BUT A
188_david_eagleman|A MACHINE A COMPUTER
188_david_patterson|IN A CALCULATOR IS THAT THE COMPUTER CAN MAKE DECISIONS
188_françois_chollet|YOU NOT JUST
188_ian_hutchinson|ON EARTH AND SO WE NEED A STRONGER FORCE
188_matt_botvinick|I WAS THE
188_peter_singer|IS THERE A CRUITT YONOW DO YOU SEE IS SUFFERINGS THE CREATIVE FORCE
188_richard_karp|ALL SOLUTIONS DECREASED BY THE COST OF THE
188_robert_langer|LIKE BUTTER COLD FACED THREE TROUS THAT ARE AT COMPLETE OR NEAR COMPLETION FOR A MAKING NEW BLOOD VESSELS
188_russ_tedrake|NO MOTORS NO CONTROL
188_sergey_levine|YOU NOW YOU JUST NEED TO EMPLOY VERY DIFFERENT STROTEGY AND
188_sheldon_solomon|MOREOVER
189_david_eagleman|FIRSVALT IT'S TERRIFIC THAT PEOPLE ARE JUMPING INTO DOING THAT CAUSE IT'S CLEARLY THE
189_david_patterson|BUT IT COULDN'T MAKE DECISIONS IT WOULD JUST IT WOULD DO THE SAME THING OVER AND OVER AGAIN
189_grant_sanderson|I THINK THE THING ABOUT INTERACTIVES THOUGH AS MOST PEOPLE CONSUMING THEM
189_joscha_bach|IS THE ENTIRETY OF EXISTENCE A STIMULATION AND WERE A KIND OF EACH MIND IS A LITTLE SUBSIMULATION
189_kate_darling|WHAT WE SHOULD FOLLOW UM IF WE CARE ABOUT CREATING SYSTEMATIC RULES THAT APPLY TO EVERYONE SO I THINK THAT
189_manolis_kellis|YEH THEY DID BUT WITHIN TWENTY FOUR HOURS THEY WERE DIBUNC
189_peter_singer|I I DON'T REALLY KNOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE SUGGESTED THAT AND I CERTAINLY CAN
189_richard_karp|AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO THAT CONSTANT
189_sergey_levine|THINGS THAT ARE FLEXIBLE THINGS THAT IF YOU PICK THEM UP THE WRONG WAY THEY'LL FALL UPSIDE DOWN AND THE CONTENTS WILL SPILL OUT SO THERE'SALL THESE LITTLE DETAILS THAT COME UP
189_sheldon_solomon|HE ARGUED IF SOME ONE TAKES YOUR PROPERTY
189_steven_pressfield|ANDD WHEN THEY ARRIVE IN INDIA
190_ben_goertzel|I WAS IN THE A EY FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF A OF A SCIENCE FICTION FERND AND I I HAD THE IDEA WAL
190_brian_kernighan|BOTH REALISTIC
190_jitendra_malik|IT DOES NOT TABULARA SALAN
190_peter_singer|HAVE NO BASIS FOR DENYING IT
190_robert_langer|THE ONE THAT MEANS YOU CAN GROW
190_sara_seager|IT'S A DESCRIPTION OF THE NUMBER OF CIVILIZATIONS OUT THERE
190_sheldon_solomon|YOU HAVE THE RIGHT
190_steven_pressfield|HE BECOMES FASCINATED BY
191_david_patterson|WOULD YOU SEE THAT GOING
191_dileep_george|AM DO THE
191_ian_hutchinson|O CONFINE THE PLACE
191_jitendra_malik|SO AT THE AGE OF SIXTEEN
191_manolis_kellis|AS THE BEAUIF SIGNS TO DAY
191_peter_singer|AND IF IT'S TRUE THEN I WOULD NOT WANT TO ELIMINATE SUFFERING COMPLETELY
191_robert_langer|THAT TISSUE AND DO VARIOUS KINDS OF EXPERIMENTS AND TERMS OFFAR IN TERMS OF DRUGS AND SO ON
191_sergey_levine|SOLVING THE GENERAL PROBLEM OF RUBOTICS
191_steven_pressfield|THE GIMNOSOPISTS THE FAKIRS THE NAKED WISEMEN THE THE YOGES
192_dileep_george|DE DU DE NURONCE ARM
192_françois_chollet|YEO I SUPPOSE THERE'S A FEAR OF BEING WRONG IF IF YOU WANT TO IF YOU WANT TO ORGANIZE YOUR IDEAS BY
192_grant_sanderson|AND WHEN YOU LOOK INTO THE ANALYTICS OF
192_manolis_kellis|IT'S NOT OW KNOWLEDGE IS FIXED
192_matt_botvinick|I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN MUCH MORE INSPIRED IN AND MY SENSE OF WONDER COMES FROM
192_peter_singer|BUT THE FOCUSIS AN AN THE ABSOLUTE NOT TO BE COLD NOT TO BE HUNGRY
192_sheldon_solomon|THERE APT TO ESCALATE RETALIATORY BEHAVIOR THUS CREATING WHAT LAW CALLD TO STATE O WAR
193_brian_kernighan|A THAT TO ADMITS I WORKE TE GUGO FOR WHILE'N
193_dileep_george|FUS TO FIND THE EDGES
193_ian_hutchinson|USING MAGNETIC FIELDS WITH THE ULTIMATE OBJECTIVE OF RELEASING FUSIAN ENERGY ON EARTH
193_kate_darling|DO I PROTECT MYSELF
193_matt_botvinick|OT FROM THE DISTANT
193_richard_karp|IN IN SUCH A WAY THAT YOU SUBTRACT THE SAME CONSTANT FROM ALL THE ELEMENTS OF THAT ROWER COLUMN
193_robert_langer|A'S AMAZING O KASO A YE SKIN
193_russ_tedrake|IS THAT JUST EVOLUTION CONSTANTLY JEST
193_sergey_levine|GENERAL INTELLIGENCE
193_sheldon_solomon|SO HE SAID IN ORDER TO AVOID A STATE O WAR PEOPLE RELUCTANTLY GIVE UP THEIR FREEDOM
194_ben_goertzel|WHY DIDN'T ALL RING TRUE TO ME A LOT IF IT DID AN BUT I COULD SEE LIKE THEIR SMART PEOPLE
194_françois_chollet|HOW DO YOU KNOW WHAT YOU THINK ABOUT SOMETHING IF SHE IF YOU DON'T WRITE IT DOWN
194_ian_hutchinson|YOU KNOW GENERATING ELECTRICITY WITH IT AND POWERING
194_jitendra_malik|AT THE AGE OF SIXTEEN THERE ALDERDY VISUAL GENIUSES
194_manolis_kellis|THE EXPECTATION THAT WERE GOING T BE WRONG
194_richard_karp|A WHILE MAINTAINING THE PROPERTY
194_robert_langer|WHAT ELSE
194_sara_seager|CAME I T THE START OF THAT WHOLE FIELD
194_sergey_levine|IS KIND OF HUMAN LEVEL CAPABILITY OF
194_sheldon_solomon|IN EXCHANGE FOR SECURITY
194_steven_pressfield|EVEN THOUGH THEY DO NOTHING BECAUSE THEY ARE INSIDE THEIR OWN
195_david_eagleman|AN OPEN HEADED SURGERY IS A BIG DEAL NARROW SURGEONS DON'T WANT TO DO IT
195_dileep_george|IT IT CONVERGES ON THE EDGE HYPORTHIS'S FIRST
195_ian_hutchinson|OUR SOCIETY WITH
195_kate_darling|BECAUSE THAT CHANGES CERTAIN CONTROLLED DECISIONS THAT YOU MAKE SO IF YOUR LIFE MATTERS MORE THAN OTHER HUMAN BEINGS
195_russ_tedrake|IS THAT A OR MAY BE THE PHYSICS OF OUR WORLD COMPLETELY LIKE
195_steven_pressfield|YOU KNOW ALL DAY LONG
196_brian_kernighan|AT THE EARLY UNUCH SDAYES FORESAW O THREADS AND MASSIVELY PARALLEL COMPUTATION
196_david_patterson|Y THIS LOOKS GREAT WE SHOULD USE THIS ONE
196_françois_chollet|WAY OF FOCET ORGANIZING YOUR THOUGHTS
196_grant_sanderson|AS MORE CONCRETE EXAMPLE LIKE MY PROCESS WITH
196_joscha_bach|IT ANTAR SILLY
196_kate_darling|THEN YOU WOULD BE MORE LIKELY TO SOAR OF OUT YOUR CURRENT LANE
196_richard_karp|ALL THE ELEMENTS ARE NOT NEGATIVE
196_russ_tedrake|LIKE A EVLUTION APPLIED NOT ONLY TO ANIMALS BUT JUST THE ENTIRETY OF IT SOMEHOW
196_sara_seager|TO KIND OF ESTIMATING AND THERE'S NO REAL ESTIMATE OR A PREDICTION OF HOW MANY CIVILIZATIONS ARE OUT THERE BUT IT'STHE WAY TO FRAME THE QUESTION AND SHOW YOU EACH TERM THAT'S INVOLVED
196_sergey_levine|THE NEEDS
197_ben_goertzel|PROBABLY MIDDLE SCHOOL THAT THEN I STARTED TO THINK WHILE THIS THIS IS SOMETHING THAT
197_brian_kernighan|FOR A LONG TIME PROCESSORS GOT FASTER
197_david_patterson|JANUARY TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN N THE ONE THAT WAS JUST LEST DECEMBER IN IT YOU NOWIT HAD FIFTY PEOPLE AT IT AND THE LEST ONE LAST DECEMBER HAD AN
197_françois_chollet|AND ONCE YOU'VE DRAWN IT THEN YOU CAN START A A ACTUALLY VOICING YOUR THOUGHTS
197_ian_hutchinson|AM THERE THOSE WALLS MUST BE KEPT AWAY FROM THE PLASMO CAUSE OTHERWISE THEY BE MELTED OR THE PLASMOD MUST BE KEPT AWAY FROM THEM INSIDE
197_jitendra_malik|MOST OF IT HAS PROBABLY BEEN ACHIEVED BY AGE TWO
197_karl_friston|THE ATHS AND THE COUNKLASS AND THE JOMETRY
197_peter_singer|EVEN IF I WERE IN THE SAME CIRCUMSTANCES AS THOSE
197_robert_langer|MIGHT BE ANOTHER WAY AND IT INCREASES THE LIKELIHOOD THAT E'LL GET ACCEPTED IF YOU USE THE PATIENTS ONSELVES YES
197_russ_tedrake|DRIVES TO EFFICIENCY LIKE NATURE LIKES EFFICIENCY
197_sheldon_solomon|I'T SO NOW HERE'S THE UCA SEE ALRERTY THING UH RIGHT SO
198_david_eagleman|SO THAT I CANTEXT FASTER YOU KNOW TWENTY PER CENT FASTER SO I THINK IT'S
198_grant_sanderson|AS LIKE THIS AGENT MAES BOTDLING THING WHERE YOU
198_karl_friston|TOO PLAN
198_kate_darling|A THEY DON'T EVER SWERVE
198_matt_botvinick|ARE YOU ALSO
198_richard_karp|WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO IS SIR
198_robert_langer|AND THEN FINALLY THERE'S A MUNA SUPPRESSIVE DRUGS WHICH YOU KNOW WELL SUPPRESS THE MEAN RESPONSE THAT'S RIGHT NOW WHAT'S DONE SAFE FOR A LIVER TRANSPLANT
199_david_eagleman|I HOW ABOUT
199_dileep_george|WHICH LAYR IS ENCORDING ARE THE EDGES
199_françois_chollet|UT IN IS ITS A KIND OF FLOWER I GUESS
199_jitendra_malik|SO THEN AT EIGHT SIXTEEN WHEN THEY GO INTO DRIVE A ED
199_matt_botvinick|LIKE ALIS FOR ME
199_peter_singer|UNDER THE NATSI REGIME HAD HAD
199_richard_karp|SMALL MOVES WHICH WILL DECREASE THE TOTAL COST
199_sara_seager|BY MORE TRADITIONAL ASTRONOMY MEANS
200_ben_goertzel|IF HOFF STEAD IT WAS RIGHT
200_david_eagleman|THE BRAIN IS  THE PERSON IS NEVER THE SAME AFTER YOU OPEN UP THEIR SKULL NOW WHETHER NOT THAT'S TRUE OR WHATEVER WHO CARES BUT
200_jitendra_malik|HEY ARE NOT LEARNING AFRESH THE VISUAL VOT
200_kate_darling|DIYOUT YOUT  YOU HAVE A HOPE THAT DAM
200_robert_langer|WILL WE ONE DAY BE ABLE TO REGENERATE ANY ORGAN OR PART OF THE OF THE HUMAN BODY
200_russ_tedrake|MEAN THERE ARE EXPERIMENTS
200_sara_seager|WE'RE LOOKING AT STARS LOOKING FOR PLANETS LOOKING FOR ROCKY PLANETS LOOKING FOR PLANETS THAT ARE THE RIGHT TEMPERATURE FOR LIFE
200_sheldon_solomon|AND IN NATURE THERE IS NO PRIVATE PROPERTY
200_steven_pressfield|WHAT IS A IN YOUR SENSE
201_david_patterson|FAMILIAR HOW DIFFICULT THIS KIND OF TRANSITION WOULD
201_joscha_bach|SO IF YOU BUILD A SYSTEM ANY KIND OF
201_karl_friston|PLANNING AND AM MOVING IN A PURPOSEFUL WAY WHERE IT COUNTENANCES THE FUTURE WHEREAS YOU MIGHT AN ANT AN
201_manolis_kellis|AND I THINK THAT'S WHATSROF
201_matt_botvinick|DISCUSSIONS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE TO BE
201_steven_pressfield|THE NATURE OF THAT CONFLICT WHAT CAN WE LEARN ABOUT SOCIETY AND HUMAN NATURE FROM THAT CONFLICT
202_david_patterson|HOW MUCH CHALLENGES THIS KIND OF TRANSITION WOULD ENTAIL
202_dileep_george|IT'S A TRIANGLE OU BUT IN THTHE CORNERS OF THE ONLY THE CORNERS OF THE TRANGLE ARE SHOWN IN THE STIMULE
202_grant_sanderson|ND THEN I PLAYED A BUNCH
202_ian_hutchinson|THE DENSITY
202_joscha_bach|EL AUTOMATON
202_karl_friston|YOU MIGHT THINK A LANCE NOT QUITE AS UNCONSCIOUS AS
202_richard_karp|SIMPLE AS IT TOUNDS
202_sergey_levine|SO KIND OF KIND OF DEALS WITH OUR WORLD
202_sheldon_solomon|YOU IF THERE'S ANYTHING THAT YOU OWN IT'S YOUR BODY
202_steven_pressfield|THAT IS ONE OF THE HOTTEST
203_brian_kernighan|AND UM
203_david_eagleman|ORTH TRYING AND IN THE SAME THE SAME IS APPLIED WITH BISI A
203_david_patterson|D YOU SEE
203_dileep_george|AND YOU CAN GO
203_grant_sanderson|AH AND THEN I SAW WHAT STORIES THERE WERE TO TELL WITHIN THAT HUM
203_jitendra_malik|THEY ARE COMING IN AS VISUAL GENUS
203_russ_tedrake|ADAPT IN ORDER TO BE MORE EFFICIENT BUT EFFICIENCY ISN'T THE ONLY GOAL OF COURSE UM SOMETIMES IT'S TOO EASY TO
203_sheldon_solomon|AND SURELY YOU HAVE A RIGHT BY NATURE TO STAY ALIVE AND THEN BY EXTENSION
204_david_patterson|COMPANIES LIKE ALIBABA AND AMAZON AND GUGUL A
204_dileep_george|INSIDE THE BRAIN AND LOOK
204_ian_hutchinson|THAN THE DENSITY OF AIR IN THIS ROOM
204_jitendra_malik|AND OF COURSE IN THEIR FUTURE
204_joscha_bach|AD ALLOW TO HE CREATION OF STRUCTUR
204_kate_darling|PROGRAMMABLE THAN WE
204_manolis_kellis|WHERE WOULD YOU GO TO LEARN
204_robert_langer|YOU KNOW SOME MOLECULES THAT MIGHT HELP REGENERATE THE SELLS AND SO I THINK THERERE DIFFERENT POSSIBILITIES WI
204_steven_pressfield|WELL WHEN I WAS WORKING ON THE LINES GATE ABOUT THE SIXDAY WAR
205_matt_botvinick|SCOPE TO AM WHAT HUMANS GO THROUGH IN IN EVERY MOMENT EN A
205_peter_singer|ILLED THOSE DEWS OR
205_richard_karp|WAT YE I OVER SIMPLIFIED SLIGHTLY WHAT YOU
205_robert_langer|WOULD HE THINK THAT MEANS FOR LONGEVITY
205_sara_seager|SONG US AY HEY HERE'S EXACTLY WHAT'S OUT THERE IT'S MEANT TO KIND OF GUIDE GUIDE OF WHERE WE'RE GOING
206_ben_goertzel|AND THAT WAS THE PROMETHEUS PROJECT
206_david_patterson|AND NOW AND A REASON A
206_dileep_george|AND IF THE SIGNAL
206_françois_chollet|HE HAS FASCINTING TO THINK THAT IF THERE IS SOMETHING TO THAT ABOUT OUR ABOUT THE WAY OUR MIND THINKS BY THE WAY AJUS CAN IM REMEMBERED
206_karl_friston|A MODEL OF
206_manolis_kellis|WHAT ARE THE BASIC PRINCIPLES SURROUNDING THESE FIRST WAVE SHECOND WAVE WHY DO THE EVEN EXIST
206_richard_karp|YOU YOU WILL END UP A SUBTRACTING A CONSTANT FROM SOME ROWSE
206_sergey_levine|WHEREAS THE CISITENS ARE BUILDING NOW DON'T HAVE TO DO THAT THEY CAN TAKE SOME SHORT CUT
207_ben_goertzel|AND THEN THE CHALLENGE WILL HAVE IS
207_françois_chollet|OBVIOUS THING THAT
207_ian_hutchinson|ISOLATES THE PLASMA WELL ENOUGH SO THAT IT SO THAT IT'S ABLE TO KEEP ITSELF BURNING WITH ITS OWN REACTION
207_karl_friston|AWAY FROM BIGDATRA MACHIE LEARNING BECAUSE AGAIN IT'S THE CONSEQUENCES OF MOVING
207_manolis_kellis|THEN UNDERSTANDING ABOUT GROWTH UNDERSTANDING ABOUT THE ARNOTS AND ARC T
207_matt_botvinick|BUT AT THE SAME TIME IT'S SO MYSTERIOUS TO US HOW
207_peter_singer|RULY HE BEAPPLE ATA
207_richard_karp|WERE COLUMNS AND ADDING THE SAME CONSTANT BACK TO OTHER ROWS AND COLUMNS
207_sergey_levine|THUS FASTENING YOU'VE A A COUPLE TIMES ALREADY SO REFRAMED THE ROLL OF ROBOTICS IN THIS WHOLE THING AND FIR FOR SOME REASON
207_steven_pressfield|THAT THIS WAS NOT  TO BE A MULTISIDED STORY I WAS TAKING IT ENTIRELY
208_brian_kernighan|WHATEVER
208_david_eagleman|LIVE WIRED
208_david_patterson|ARM IS AN INSTRUCTIONS LIKE A RISK BASED YE ITS A RISK BASE INSTRUCTOR TSET AS A PROPRIETARY ONE ARM STANDS FOR A
208_dileep_george|RECEIVING ANYTHING FROM DEN
208_grant_sanderson|BE THE ONE TO DECIDE WHAT'S THE INTERESTING THING TO WALK THROUGH HERE UM
208_joscha_bach|THE THE BRAIN THE MIND
208_kate_darling|THE PROBLEM AND AVOID LIABILITY IN ANY WAY POSSIBLE OR LIKE
208_matt_botvinick|SADDENS ME HOW
208_richard_karp|A SO AS NOT TO I
208_robert_langer|WELL SEE
208_sara_seager|NUMBERS OF
208_sergey_levine|ENOUGH ON MY WAY OF THINKING IS COMMON BUT I THOUGHT LIKE
208_steven_pressfield|I IDENTIFY WITH THES E RALIE PEOPLE I WAS GOING TO SEE IT ENTIRELY FROM THEIR SIDE
209_ben_goertzel|THE
209_brian_kernighan|TO MAKE IT WORTH LEARNING A NEW LANGUAGE AT THE SAME TIME NEVER GOING TO HAPP
209_david_eagleman|IWHEN ON THE HUMAN SIDE AND TEMTABIAL TO COMMUNICATE IT ICA
209_david_patterson|ADVANCED RISK
209_dileep_george|INTE THEN WOT IS BLACK
209_françois_chollet|THEIR BULLET POINT LISTS
209_grant_sanderson|AD EVEN THOUGH THERE'S LOTS OF OTHER INTERESTING PATHS THAT ONE COULD TAKE

214_brian_kernighan|QUESTION
214_jitendra_malik|YOU THINK YOLL NOWUSK AN DO THE SAME
214_manolis_kellis|WHY ARE THE COMORBIDITIES AND THESE RISK FACTORS

214_steven_pressfield|TO META THE THE SIXTH DAY WAR WAS ABOUT AS I SAID A RETURN FROM EXILE FROM DIASPERA AFTER TWO THOUSAND YEARS NOW OBVIOUSLY
215_david_eagleman|DON'T ACTUALLY REQUIRE THE PERFECT COMMON LANGUAGE SO FOR EXAMPLE
215_dileep_george|VHEN VENIDISENT ELUCIDY EDGE
215_françois_chollet|AND THEN IT GIVES YOU SENTENCES
215_karl_friston|NT SELF AWARE
215_matt_botvinick|AN EARLY DEBATE IN
215_peter_singer|WOULD HAVE BEEN DIFFERENT FROM THE MAJORITY AM IS IT A WORTH WHILTHING TO CONTEMPLATE
215_russ_tedrake|DID YOU DECIDE TO SEND SOME COMMANDS TO YOUR MOTOR OR DID YOU JUST LEAVE THE MOTORS OFF AND LET THEM DO THEIR WORK OR
215_sara_seager|O WE JUST TAKE A NUMBER

216_dileep_george|AH IT IS CLEARLY NOT IN THE INPORT IT IS COMING FROM THE CONTEXT

216_joscha_bach|LIT LIVES AND DIES
216_karl_friston|THEY WOILD PROBABLY ARGUE ABOUT THEIR FAVORITE CAT
216_peter_singer|IT WOULD BE INTERESTING IF WE COULD FIND A WAY OF REALLY FINDING THESE ANSWERS AND
216_robert_langer|LOWER THE BAR ARE NOT

217_joscha_bach|IF IF THE MIND IS NOT RELLY REAL AT IS NOT HTHAT THE THE BIRTH AND DEATH IS NOT A
217_kate_darling|OLL LIKE WHEN WE'RE THINKING ABOUT THESE TROLLY PROBLEMS AND AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES AND HOW TO PROGRAM ETHICS INTO MACHINES AND HOW TO YOU KNO MAKE
217_manolis_kellis|NOT EVEN AWARE THAT THEY'RE SPREADING

218_françois_chollet|'S NOT SOMANTICALLY SEARCHABLE
218_karl_friston|COMPLEX PLANNING YA
218_russ_tedrake|LIKE IF YOU LOOK A BILOGICAL SYSTEMS
218_sara_seager|THEN I WANTED TO KNOW WHAT KIND OF STARS ARE
219_brian_kernighan|ABSOTLIN NO WAY YOU COULD FORGET WHICH IN THESE THOUSAND DIFFERENT PACKAGES AND I THINK IT'S WORSE
219_david_patterson|AND THE SUPHON AND THE NO THINGS IT ISN'T
219_dileep_george|THEY HAPPENED LATER
219_grant_sanderson|TO A SURFACE
219_ian_hutchinson|THE LONG WAY ROUND
219_jitendra_malik|I THINK THAT HUMAN LEARNING IS FAR RICHER THAN THAT
219_joscha_bach|A SILLY
219_karl_friston|NOT TAKE OUT FURTHERGRAFER YOUR ABSOLUTELYURIRT AGAIN THE LINE IS UNCLEAR BUT IT SEEMS LIKE
219_matt_botvinick|BECAUSE OF COURSE YOU KNOW THE RULE IS AD E D BUT THAT'S NOT ALWAYS WHAT YOU DO SO YOU HAVE T HAVE A LIST OF EXCEPTIONS AND IM
219_richard_karp|IIN INTO SOMETHING BEAUTIFUL AND ORDERLY
219_robert_langer|BUT YOU WANT TO GIVE IT SOME CANCER
219_sara_seager|QUIET CALLED IT
220_ben_goertzel|THESE ARE ALL AROUND
220_brian_kernighan|DISTRIBUTION OF HOW THEY ARE USED THER M
220_david_eagleman|AND THE BRAIN CAN FIGURE OUT WHAT TO DO WITH THE DAY THAT COMES IN AND AND PARTLYE REASON THAT I
220_david_patterson|IT'S BELIEVE THAT THERE SAY ENERGY DISADVANTAGE OF USING
220_grant_sanderson|WITHOUT INTERSECTING ITSELF
220_ian_hutchinson|DOUGHNOC ROUND THE TOUROIS
220_matt_botvinick|IF YOU LOOK AT ACTUALLY LOOK AT
220_richard_karp|IN SOMETHING ABOUT THE ORDERLY SYSTEMATIC
220_russ_tedrake|DO YOU THINK IT'S A DYNAMIC SYSTEM
220_sergey_levine|KIND OF FOR THE T
220_sheldon_solomon|THOSE BECOME YOUR APPLES THAT'S YOUR PROPERTY
220_steven_pressfield|IN OUR RELIGIOUS
221_brian_kernighan|WELL TWO THOUSAND LANGUAGES THAT ARE STILL IN USE THAT NOBODY USES
221_dileep_george|FOLKS YI MEAN THAT FOR THAT'S CRAZY THAT THERE'S ALL THESE FEEBACK CONNECTIONS AT ME WE OFTEN THINK ABOUT
221_grant_sanderson|OR I'LL LEAVE IT TO YOU TAH
221_ian_hutchinson|AM SO YOU GOT TO IMAGINE THAT THERE IS THE STOGHNUT SHAPE WITH AN EMBEDDED MAGNETIC FIELD JUST GOING ROUND AND ROUND THE LONG WAY
221_joscha_bach|IT SEEMS THAT THE PHYSICAL BEING A PHYSICAL OBJECT IN THIS WORLD
221_manolis_kellis|AND THEY'RE LIKE WIUD YOU PUBLISHED I NATURE SO MANY NATURE BAPERS WRONG AND MY ANSWER IS
221_matt_botvinick|CORPORA LIKE LANGUAGE CORPORA
221_peter_singer|AM
221_richard_karp|NATURE OF AH
221_sheldon_solomon|IF SOMEBODY ELSE WANTS TO PUT A FENCE AROUND NEBRASKA
222_david_eagleman|AND THE BRAIN FIGURES OUT WHAT TO DO WITH THE DATA AND I DON'T BELIEVE THAT MOTHER NATURE HAS TO REINVENT THE
222_david_patterson|THE OTHER ASPECT OF THIS IS I FULOK AT APPLE QUALCOM SAMSONG WALWAY ALL USE THE
222_dileep_george|ITHANK
222_françois_chollet|OUR SPARSE DISPERT THOUGHTS
222_ian_hutchinson|THE THTHE BIG ADVANTAGE OF THAT IS THAT
222_jitendra_malik|I A CHILD
222_kate_darling|IF GIVEN THI THINK YOU WOULD HAVE TO ASK THEM A SERIES OF DIFFERENT QUESTIONS IN ORDER TO GET UP WHAT THEIR CONSENSUS IS
222_manolis_kellis|NO NO NO SO MANY PANATURE PAPERS ARE SCRUTINIZED
222_matt_botvinick|IT'S IT TURNS OUT TO BE VERY RICH BECAUSE YES THERE THERE ARE THERE'S A INI
222_robert_langer|OR BY ENGINEERING
222_sergey_levine|SO IN A SENSE I WOULD SAY YES THAT IT HAS A PLACE AND IN MANY WAYS THAT PLACE IS OR INO
223_david_patterson|THE RIGHT TO BUILD THEIR OWN
223_françois_chollet|A POETICALLY REPRESENT
223_grant_sanderson|MY HOPE WOULD BE AS THE
223_karl_friston|SO MATHEMATICALLY DESCRIBING THAT
223_kate_darling|AGREE BUT THAT THAT HAS TO DO MORE WITH THE ARTIFICIAL NATURE OF AN EITHER SHOWING SOME ACUTE ICONS ON A SCREEN
223_matt_botvinick|WHICH VERBS SHOULD BE EXCEPTIONAL AND THEN THERE ARE SOME EXCEPTIONS TO THE EXCEPTIONS AND THERE WAS A WORD THAT WAS A
223_peter_singer|CAN ANSWER YOUR LARGER QUESTION OF HOW MANY PEOPLE WOULD HAVE BEEN CAPABLE OF DOING THAT
223_robert_langer|DO YOU SEE THAT THERE IS A
223_russ_tedrake|IT'S MY FIFTH METACARPEL
223_sara_seager|THAD BLOCKS THE LIGHT REMAIN FOR A BLACK BLOB THAT BLOCKS LIGHT AND THEN TRYING TO SAY SOMETHING ABOUT THE SIZE OF THE PLANET
224_brian_kernighan|SO LET'S GO TO SOMETHING THAT WWHEN I FOUND OUT
224_david_patterson|MOST OF THE OTHER PEOPLE WHO BUILD LIKE HANDRIGHT PHONES JUST GET ONE OF THE DESIGNS FROM
224_grant_sanderson|I LEAVE IT TO YOU TO THINK ABOUT WHY YOU WOULD EXPECT THAT TO BE TRUE AND THEN TO WANT TO KNOW WHAT
224_kate_darling|THAT'S THAT'S ALMOST
224_matt_botvinick|THE WAY THAT DEEP LEARNING WAS DEPLOYED INCOGNITIVE PSYCHOLOGY WAS
224_robert_langer|HER FACESHIFTS
224_sara_seager|AH FROM
224_steven_pressfield|AS E POSTO MAY BE FUL LOOK AT THE U S
225_ben_goertzel|TO US A CERTAIN POINT
225_brian_kernighan|MAXIMISE OR MINIMISE
225_grant_sanderson|ASPECTS OF A MOBI STRIPT YOU WANT A FORMALIE SUCH THAT YOU CAN PROVE THAT INTUITION THAT YOU HAVE
225_ian_hutchinson|BECAUSE OF THE
225_jitendra_malik|AND THE CHILD HAS COMMANDED THE MOVEMENT SO THAT'S THE KIND OF LEARNING DATA BUT THE LEARNING DATA HAS BEEN
225_joscha_bach|THE PHYSICS THAT F EXPERIENCE IS NOT THE REAL PHYSICS THAT IS UNE WAS NO COLOR AND SOUND IN THE REAL WORLD W
225_karl_friston|UNDENIABLY TRUE
225_manolis_kellis|MUCH HIGHER THAN ANY OTHER JOURN
225_matt_botvinick|THAT WAS THE SPIRIT OF IT
225_richard_karp|IS THAT SOMETHING A SPECIFIC
225_russ_tedrake|M IN WAYS YOU DON'T EXPECT WHEN YOURE OPENING JARS
225_sergey_levine|I DON KNOW WHAT TO MAKE OF THIS FACT AT A
225_steven_pressfield|WELL A EUC DEPLE GO I MEAN
226_ben_goertzel|YYOU COULDN'T MAKE IT REAL SO AND
226_david_patterson|AH AND THAT'S GIVEN
226_grant_sanderson|CAUSE AT SOME POINT NOW YOU'RE STARTING TO
226_ian_hutchinson|ELICAL ORBIT
226_manolis_kellis|SO IF YOU BASICLY
226_matt_botvinick|IT WAS ABOUT THAT RICHNESS UN
226_richard_karp|WE BORN THIS WAY
226_robert_langer|I THINK THERE'S BOTH YOU KNOW EVERY SO OFTEN A NEW TECHNIQUE OR NEW TECHNOLOGY COMES OUT AH
226_sara_seager|OUT OF ALL THE STARS THERE ARE ACCESSIBLE TO WHATEVER TELESCOPE SOME OF THEM ARE JUST BAD FOR WHATEVER REASON YOU'RE NOCCAMEAL TO FIND PLANETS AROUND THEM
226_sheldon_solomon|BUT THEN HE SAYS MONEY CAME INTO THE PICTURE
226_steven_pressfield|HERE IN THE UNITED STATES
227_brian_kernighan|KIND OFOPTIMIZATION
227_david_eagleman|POSSIBLE TO CO
227_jitendra_malik|AND THIS IS A VERY RICH
227_joscha_bach|RIGHT IN END SO ALL THAT IS FILTERED THROUGH WITH THE CUTS OF THE CONSCIOUSNESS THAT SUMERGENT IN AR
227_kate_darling|THEY THEIR DICITION BE VERY DIFFERENT
227_peter_singer|THAT ARE OBJECTIVELY GOOD
227_sheldon_solomon|AND THIS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT'S HE NOTICED
228_david_patterson|FASTER THAN MOST TO EVERYBODY ELSE'S PHONES THAT ARE THERE
228_dileep_george|OBJECTS BEHAVING THE WORLD
228_françois_chollet|OF NATURAL LANGUAGES HARD TO INTERPRET
228_jitendra_malik|CHILD CAN DO RADIAZ EXPERIMENTS WITH THE WORLD
228_karl_friston|WHAT THE PRACTICAL THING WHICH YOU AM
228_kate_darling|I THINK IF I AGREE WITH THAT
228_manolis_kellis|UNETIAL CONTENTS BY BUT BY THE NUMBER OF REVISIONS THEN OF COURSE IT'S GOINGTO BE THE BEST SOURCE OF KNOWLEDGE EVENTUALLY
228_peter_singer|IT'S USEFUL TO THINK ABOUT WHETHER
228_richard_karp|I USED TO ERE AMUSE MYSELF BY MULTIPLYING FOR DIGER
228_robert_langer|WHAT'S YOUR VIEW
228_sara_seager|THESE TRANSITING PLANETS FOR EXAMPLE NOT ALL PLANETS TRANSIT
228_sergey_levine|WHY MADE THE DECISIONS IT DID LIKE TELLA A CONVINCING STORY AND
229_ben_goertzel|WHICH IS DIFFERENT THAN PEOPLE COMING INTO THE FIELD
229_david_patterson|TO TEMPTATION AND ENGINEERING
229_dileep_george|IND AND WER CONSTANTLY PROJECTING THAT MORTAL BACK ON TO THE WOOD
229_joscha_bach|ERE YOU HAVE IDENTIFICATIONS THERE SOMETHING MEANS SOMETHING WHERE YOU ARE THE INSIDE OF A FITBACKLOPE ON THE DIMENSIONS OF
229_manolis_kellis|A STILL VERY SUPERFICI
229_peter_singer|I'M NOT WILLING TO DO SOMETHING OR I DON'T EVEN I'M NOT WILLING TO ACKNOWLEDGE SOMETHING AS GOOD AND THE RIGHT THING TO DO BECAUSE I'M SIMPLY SCARED OF
229_russ_tedrake|BUT ACTUALLY MY BONE HAS REMODDLED
229_sheldon_solomon|THAT MONEY IS FUNKYCAUSE IT HAS NO INTRINSIC VALUE
229_steven_pressfield|FROM IF YOUARE IN ISRAEL
230_brian_kernighan|WHAT IS THE
230_dileep_george|SO WHAT WE ARE SEEING
230_joscha_bach|OF CARING AURBASICALLY DIMENSONS OF THIS MORTIVATIONAL SYSTEM THAT WE EMERGE OVER THE THE MEANING OF THE RELATIONS THE GRAF
230_karl_friston|A PROBALISTIC DESCRIPTION OF AM CAUSES AND CONSEQUENCES
230_richard_karp|AND THEM
230_sara_seager|IM AS VIEWED FROM YOU
231_ben_goertzel|HOW THAT HELD THE SUPER MAN
231_david_eagleman|TO GET THIS FOOD INTO HER MOUTH WITH THE ROBOTIC ARM BECAUSE THAT IS WHAT MATTERS
231_françois_chollet|WE WERE TALKING ABOUT
231_grant_sanderson|BUT ITS BOUNDARY SITS EXACTLY ON THE PLAIN I DON'T THINK I CAN DO THAT WITHOUT CROSSING ITSELF
231_manolis_kellis|I FIND IT ADMIRAL SUPERFICIAL IS THE RIGHT WORD A
231_matt_botvinick|WHAT WHATEVER WE DO UNDERSTAND ABOUT THE BIOLOGICAL NOTE NOTWORKS AND OUR BRAIN IS THERE E
231_robert_langer|THE PATENT SYSTEM BECAUSE THAN ANYBODY ELSE COULD DO IT
231_sheldon_solomon|AND YOU HAVE A CHOICE BETWEEN A CARROT AND A LUMP OF GOLD IN THE DESERT MOST PEOPLE ARE GOING TO GO FOR THE CARROT
231_steven_pressfield|ALL THOSE PEOPLE WHO HATE US
232_ben_goertzel|WOULD APPEAR BUT HE WAS
232_david_eagleman|WELL LET'S A
232_françois_chollet|KIND OF COGNITION
232_ian_hutchinson|SO THAT'S WHITE'S TURROUDAL AND THAT'S WHY WE HAVE A STRONG MAGNETIC FIELD THAT IT IT'S
232_karl_friston|THE OBJECTIVE FUNCTION
232_sara_seager|IT WILL NEVER GO IN FRONT OF THE STAR
232_sergey_levine|THAT SERE INFERENCS TOMSOF LEARNING BASE
233_brian_kernighan|AMATRIX AND THEN PASS THAT OFF TO A SOLPER WHICH IS AN ENTIRELY SEPARATE THING
233_françois_chollet|AND LANGUAGE
233_joscha_bach|ASKED THE QUESTION OF WHAT IS CONSCIOUSNESS TO BE OBSERVED MORE SYSTEMATICALLY WHAT WHAT WHAT DO YOU HOW DO YOU THINK ABOUT
233_manolis_kellis|A LIKE CERTAIN COMPUTER SCIENCE LIKE IN THE MACHINE LEARNING WORLD ARTICLES THEN THEY DON'T
233_peter_singer|AT IF THEIRSE THINGS ARE CONVENIENT
233_sergey_levine|SYSTEMS WILL BE
234_ben_goertzel|OHER SUPERMEN
234_david_eagleman|OUR BRAIN IS ABLE TO
234_david_patterson|A THE SOPHORSTYPHORIST FIVE CAN RUN JUST ON THOSE FORTY INSTRUCTIONS AND THEN THEY PROVIDE OPTIONAL
234_dileep_george|I WOULDN'T PUT IT AS CALFITING THE DIFFERENCETS MORE LIKE WHAT IS THE BEST EXPLANATION FOR
234_joscha_bach|NTHESE FATED SAMS AND YOU CAN APPROXIMATE MORE MOST POLYNOMS WISTHES E
234_manolis_kellis|AS OFTEN TAKE THE A THE BIGGER PICTURE VIEW
234_matt_botvinick|IN TERMS OF VA THE GAP WE MIGHT WANT TO TRY TO CLOSE IN TRYING TO CREATE A HUMAN LEVEL INTELLIGENCE
234_russ_tedrake|SO THE IDEA THAT SOMEHOW
234_sara_seager|SO THAN THE NEXT SO ALL THESE FACTORS SO FAR
234_sergey_levine|AS EXPLAINABLE AS THE DREAM WAS WITH EXPERT SYSTEMS FOR EXAMPLE
234_sheldon_solomon|I THEN HE SAYS WELL
235_ben_goertzel|WOULD BE OU WAS THE VERY
235_brian_kernighan|CONSTRAINTS ON THE MODEL SO A SO ALL AMPLE DOES IS TO GENERATE THAT KIND OF THING AND THEN SOLVER CAN
235_david_eagleman|A JUST TO SO MUCH
235_dileep_george|THE THEN POT STIMULES
235_françois_chollet|THINK REASONS ABOUT THINGS
235_grant_sanderson|AND THE SHORT ENTER IS
235_ian_hutchinson|IN THE IN THE DIRECTION THAT WOULD LEAD THE PARTICLES TO LEAVE THE CHAMBER
235_kate_darling|TETHING THAT CAN BE ENGINEERED
235_robert_langer|YUVEIN CLINICAL TROUS
235_sergey_levine|I THINK IT'S A VERY COMPLICATED QUESTION BECAUSE I THINK THAT
235_sheldon_solomon|HE REALITY IS IS THAT
236_david_eagleman|AH THAT YOU KNOW SO MANY THINGS HAPPENED THIS YEAR TWENTY TWENTY
236_david_patterson|AND THEN OPTIONAL FEATURES THAT IF YOU TURN THEM ON THE COMPELLERS WERE USED BUT YOU DON'T HAVE TO I THINK IT'S A POWERFUL IDEA
236_françois_chollet|IT'S POSSIBLE I THINK
236_peter_singer|OW WILLING YOU ARE TO DO THE RIGHT THING WHEN THE COST IS HIGH
236_robert_langer|THAT IS BY FAR THE MOST EXTERMS OF MONEY OR PAIN OR BOTH
236_steven_pressfield|AS THE JEWISH PEOPLE HAVE HAD NO POWER THROUGHOUT THE DIASPERA FOR EVER
237_ben_goertzel|KNOW HOW THE HUMAN MIND CONSTRUCTS THE ILLUSION OF ISELF HOW IT CONSTRUCTS THE ILLUSION OF FREE WILL HOW HOW IT CONSTRUCTS
237_brian_kernighan|A PREDECESSOR TO THE TEC FAMILY OF THINGS IT'S A FORMATOR THAT WAS DONE AT BELL LIVES IN THIS
237_dileep_george|GOT IND THAT'S WHERE ALL THE ILLUSIONS COME IN AND THAT'S BUT THAT'S THAT'S INCREDITBLY EFFICIENT
237_françois_chollet|AS SREASONABLE TO ASSUME THE DIS
237_grant_sanderson|IT'S NOT AS IF SOMEONE WAS SITTING THERE THINKING LIKE I WONDER WHAT THE PROPERTIES OF CLAY ARE I HAD SOME ARBITRARY RULES ABOUT WHAT WHEN I CAN'T CUT IT N WHEN I
237_jitendra_malik|TE NEW NEW METHODS OF LEARNING
237_joscha_bach|QUITE I THINK IT MODELS ONLY ONE ASPECT OF ATTENTION IN THE EARLY DAYS OF AUTOMATED A LANGUAGE TRANSLATION THERE WITH A
237_kate_darling|AN NAY I SISTEMANY AN HE HUMAN OH YET FOR SIRE DYO END D' YO SEE IT BEING USED THAT WAY OFTEN LIKE A
237_manolis_kellis|I MEAN FOR SOME TOPICS THERE'S BEEN A HUGE AMOUNT OF WORK FOR OTHER TOPICS IS JUST A STUB
237_matt_botvinick|A LAYERS I GUESS WHERE
237_richard_karp|BENT BUT SOMEHOW I FOUND THAT I COULD IMPRESS THEM BY A
237_robert_langer|IN GENERAL WHAT TAKES TO PROVE THAT SOMETHING IS EFFECTIVE ON HUMANS
237_russ_tedrake|CAZARME
237_sheldon_solomon|AR MORE THE WORD THAT HE USED WAS INDUSTRIOUS HE SAID SOME PEOPLE MORE INDUSTRIOUS THAN OTHERS
237_steven_pressfield|RIGHT THEN IT JUST A HUMAN NATURE
238_françois_chollet|SOME LEVEL OF TOPOOGICAL PROCESSING IN THE BRAIN THAT THE BRAIN IS A
238_grant_sanderson|CAN'T GLO IT INSTEAD  THERE'S A TON
238_joscha_bach|EXAMPLE THAT I FOUND PARTICULARLY FUNNY WHERE SOMEBODY TRIED TO TRANSLATE A TAX FROM ENGLISH INTO GERMAN AND IT WAS A A BED BROKE THE WINDOW
238_kate_darling|I DON'T
238_manolis_kellis|SO YOU KNOW I GOT IT YE WELL YOU ACTUALLY THE
238_richard_karp|BY PERFORMING THI MENTAL MOMELTER OF MENTAL ARITHMETIC YET THERE'S SOMETHING TO DO THAT AT
238_russ_tedrake|IT'S TENDED TO CREATE SOME INTERESTING THINGS OF BY PEEDLE WALKING
238_sara_seager|I CALL IT FRACTION OF PLANETS IN THE HABITABLE ZONE
239_ben_goertzel|THE SUPERMAN WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A MIND THAT WOULD THIS WE HAVE COMPLETE RUTE ACCESS TO ITS OWN
239_dileep_george|CONSTANTLY A
239_françois_chollet|THEY ASSOCIATIVE IN NATURE
239_grant_sanderson|THET UM CAN ACTUALLY BE EQUIVALENT TO
239_ian_hutchinson|YEAR EVENTUALLY AIN AN EFFUSIONRY ACTOR THERE WILL BE DUTRONS AND TRITY AND TRITONS AND THEY WILL BE SMASHING IN THEY WILL BE VERY HOT
239_robert_langer|IT IS PARICULAR DISEASE BUT THE PROCESS
239_russ_tedrake|A BIT THERE'S A GOOD I THINK WE ARE THE
239_sara_seager|BECAUSE BELIEVE D OR NOT WE HAVE A HANDLE ON THAT FOR A CERTAIN SET OF STARS
239_sergey_levine|YOU KNOW WHAT WHY DO YOU WANT YOUR SYSTEM TO EXPLAIN ITSELF WELL SO THAT IT'S SO THAT WHEN IT SCREWS UP
240_david_patterson|SURPRISING TO ME THAT IS
240_dileep_george|AH SA YOU NO PHYZICALLY IF YOU HAVE A MODEL OF THE WOOL
240_françois_chollet|AND
240_grant_sanderson|LIK S TROPOLOGY IN THE WAY THET MATHEMETICIANCY TO POLOGY BUT I DON'T THINK IT NEEDS TO TAKE THAT TIME I THINK THERE'S T
240_jitendra_malik|POWER OF THE HUMAN BRAIN VERSES THE COMPUTERS OF TO DAY IN TERMS OF INSTRUCTIONS PER SECOND
240_karl_friston|I'VE JUST TOLD YOU ALL YOU NEED TO DOSE O WRIGHT DOWN YOU'RE YOUR PERFECT
240_kate_darling|TRYING TO OPTIMIZE FOR THE ANTHROPOMORPHISATION
240_peter_singer|SO IR RIGHT YOU KNOW
240_robert_langer|AS EARLY INTERESTING LINE
240_russ_tedrake|MOST SUCCESSFUL BY FEL IGH I THINK SOME E I THINK HAVE READ SOMEWHERE THAT DONE
240_sara_seager|WE KNOW FROM OUR THE KEPLER SPACE TELESCOPE THAT OPERATED FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS
240_sheldon_solomon|AD OTHER PEOPLE NOT MUCH AT ALL
241_david_patterson|COMPLICATED A AS IT IS TO BUILD THESE THINGS A NO A
241_dileep_george|IN MEN WEN
241_grant_sanderson|AH TANGIBLE LIKE ACTUALLY ADDS VALUE TO PEOPLE'S LIVES THROUGH THE PREDICTIONS THAT IT MAKES AH BUT THAT LINE ISN'T ALWAYS DRAWN BECAUSE
241_ian_hutchinson|SO THEY WERE MOVING THIRMLY WITH VERY LARGE THERMAL ENERGIES IN RANDOM DIRECTIONS
241_manolis_kellis|EVERY TIME I CRETICIZED SOMETHING I SHOULD FEEL PARTLY RESPONSIBLE BUSICALLIF MORE PEOPLE FOR MY COMMUNITY WENT THERE AND EDITED
241_matt_botvinick|ONE THING I OFTEN THINK ABOUT IS THAT UM
241_peter_singer|I'M NOT SAYING THERE WERE ANY TERRIBLE SANCTIONS OBVIOUSLY BUT I I THOUGHT ABOUT THAT AND I
241_sara_seager|HAVE ESTIMATES FOR HOW MANY PLANETS FROM THE SO CALLE HABITALZONE  THE HOSTSTAR FOR CERTAIN TYPISTR
242_brian_kernighan|ALL THE AMAZING WORK YOU'VE DONE YOU'VE ALSO DONE WORK IN GRAFT THEORY
242_david_patterson|UNDERLYING ALL COMPUTATION ALL TOURING MACHINES ALL
242_dileep_george|SOME EVIDENCE GUMSON
242_françois_chollet|A TABORGICAL SPACE A IS BETTER MEDIUM
242_joscha_bach|THE ADISFLANG MAMEL BROKE THE BINDOW WIS A BASEBALL BET
242_manolis_kellis|I JUST THAT THERE'S DIFFERENT MODES OF COMMUNICATION IN DIFFERENT FIELDS
242_matt_botvinick|ARTICULATING
242_peter_singer|GUESS I DECIDED RELL
242_richard_karp|EARLY TEEN YEARS WHEN YOU WERE
242_robert_langer|FIRST DO NO HARM FOR I DO NO HARM THAT'S RIGHT SO I
242_sara_seager|SO ALL THOSE WE HAVE MEASURABLE AND THEN LIKE THE DRAKE EQUATION ITSELF THER ARE SOME TERMS WE CAN NOT MEASURE
243_brian_kernighan|AH
243_françois_chollet|TO UNCOULD THOUGHTS
243_grant_sanderson|PROPERLY DRAW THAT LINE OUT AH AND OFTEN I THINK POPULARIES
243_joscha_bach|SO A WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT LANGUAGE WE HAVE DIFFERENT WORDS THAT
243_karl_friston|WE ARE SIMILAR KINDS OF CREATURES
243_matt_botvinick|WHAT THE SIGNIFICANCE OF A TURRING MACHINE IS IS THAT ITIT'S A MACHINE EMULATOR
243_russ_tedrake|TO A PLACE OF SHELTER AND SO ON TO SHARE WITH OTHERS DO YOU UNDERSTAND IT ALL THE VALUE
243_sara_seager|AND THOSE ONES I CALL THEM F L FRACTION OF ALL THOSE PLANETS THAT HAVE LIFE ON THEM
244_ben_goertzel|SOME QUITE ABSTRACT THINKINGS ANO NOW WEARE THE TIME IN HISTORY WON
244_brian_kernighan|THE ANSWER IS NO ALLOYD I AM TOLD THAT SOMEBODY ASKS
244_david_eagleman|AND THAT'S WONDERFUL
244_dileep_george|YOU ARE TRYING TO NOW EXPLAIN THIS
244_françois_chollet|TEN GEOMETRIC SPACE AND SO I THINK WAS THE DIFFERENCE IN A TOPOLOGICAL AND A GEOMETRIC SPACE GHEO
244_joscha_bach|SO THE LANGUAGE IS BASI WITH PROJECTION
244_karl_friston|THAT IS CONSTITUTED BY THINGS LIKE ME PHASICALLY A SOCIAL WORLD A COMMUNITY
244_kate_darling|OTHER THAT IF IT'S A PLEASANT FEELING
244_manolis_kellis|ITS RELEGATED AND
244_russ_tedrake|VA WALKIN A TWO FEE
244_sergey_levine|TREATED THAT SENTENCE NOT AS A COMMAND FROM A PERSON BUT AS A REPRESENTATION OF THE INTERNAL
244_steven_pressfield|HATREDS AND ANIMOSITIES THOUSANDS OF YEARS OLD
245_ben_goertzel|A LOT OF THESE IDEAS
245_david_eagleman|I DON'T KNOW WHY THIS QUESTION POPPED INTO MY HEAD IT'S QUITE ABSURD BUT A ARE WE GONG TO BE O K
245_dileep_george|EVIDENCE YOU SING YOUR MORTAL OF THE WORLD EAND THIS INFERENCE
245_matt_botvinick|THAT THAT TO ME YOU KNOW THAT THAT AND OF THAT WAY OF LOOKING AT IT AT A TURNING MACHINE
245_robert_langer|UNO WORK ON WRIDING A PATENT
245_sergey_levine|LANGUISED DESCRIPTIONS
246_brian_kernighan|PRETTY DARN WELL
246_david_eagleman|HAMPSTER WUEAL LIKE THAT OF HABIT A LOT OF PEOPLE
246_grant_sanderson|I THINK THERE ARE CERTAIN IDEAS THERE OF GROWTH OF EXPINENTIAL GROWTH WHAT
246_ian_hutchinson|ERE I THERE SOME LEAKING OF HEAT ALL THE TIME A RADIATION SOME TRANSPORT AND SO FOR
246_joscha_bach|INTO DISCREET STRING OF CYMBOLS AND A WHAT THE TRANSFORMER IS ABLE TO IT LEARNS A
246_karl_friston|I THINK THAT THE SPECIAL THING ABOUT SELF AWARE ARTIFACTS IS THAT THEY HAVE LEARNED
246_matt_botvinick|KNOS IT REALLY STICKS WITH ME I THINK OF
246_robert_langer|AND A THEN YOU GO BACK AND FORTH WITH THE OU S PITIOU THATS THE UNIT STATES PATEN AN TRADE MARK OFFICE AND YOU KNOW THEY
246_sara_seager|TELESCOPE AND INSTRUMENT TOOLS
247_ben_goertzel|CENTURY LATER OR TRANSPORTED THROUGH TIME WAIT WAITINNG HE WOULD SAY BY DE AY AND HE THOSE ARE QUITE DIFFERENT IF HE'S BORN A CENTURY LATER
247_brian_kernighan|HOW DID YOU YOU WEREN'T EVEN THINKING INTERS OF CLASSES YOU WARE JUST TRYING TO FIN NO SUCH IDEA A HUMORISTIC THAT CAN A
247_david_eagleman|HAD HAD TO REINVENT THEMSELVES UNFORTUNATELY IN THAT AVE A LOT OF FRIENDS WHO
247_grant_sanderson|MAYBE HAVE YOU LEARNED
247_ian_hutchinson|TAKE THE ENERGY
247_matt_botvinick|HUMANS AS
247_richard_karp|YOU CANT NAW
247_robert_langer|MAY NOT ALLOW IT THE FIRST SECOND OR THIRD TIME BUT THEY WILL TELL YOU WHY THEY DON'T
247_sheldon_solomon|FUNDAMENTALLY DEEPLY A INTERCONNECTED BETWEEN US I DO I THINK THAT PLATO AND SOCRATES
248_ben_goertzel|YE BUT IF HOU WAS TRANSPORTED THROUGH TIME DO YOU THINK O
248_david_patterson|THAT THAT'S A A HUGE A CHANGE OF WHAT'S GOT GONE ON
248_ian_hutchinson|DRIVE SOME KIND OF AM
248_jitendra_malik|IT'S OF ALREADY DIFFERENT STYLE
248_peter_singer|CLIMATE CHANGE WOULD BE A THIRD QUESTION WHERE AGAIN
248_richard_karp|CONSOLVED LITTLE PUZZLES ABOUT CA CANNIBALS AN MISSIONARY HEETHEA AND THE
248_sheldon_solomon|YENO IN THE CRIDO WERE CLOSER TO THE TRUTH
249_brian_kernighan|PATH OF
249_david_eagleman|YOU KNOW AS BASICALLY I IT'S TAKING THE DREAMS THAT PEOPLE HAD AND
249_david_patterson|FOR CERTAIN APPLICATIONS
249_dileep_george|USING THE FEET FOR WORD FEET BACK PROPAGATION OAN
249_françois_chollet|EMIA THE MUZUMAV SECOND E LET'S GET INTO YOUR PAPER ON THE MEASURE OF INTELLIGENCE
249_grant_sanderson|PANDAMICS FROM FROM MAKING THAT VIDIO BECAUSE IT WAS KIND OF EXPLORTORY O WERE KIND OF BUILDING UP AN INTUITION AND IT'S AGAIN
249_jitendra_malik|AH
249_karl_friston|THAT'S BRILLIANT A I'VE NEVER THOUGHT OF THAT I NEVER THOUGHT OF THAT DA
249_kate_darling|VERY PRIMITIVE AND I THINK THAT
249_matt_botvinick|ON CHARACTER
249_richard_karp|THIS A KIND OF ACHIEVEMENT ITS ITS ITS PUZZLE SOLVING
249_sergey_levine|THE CONVINCINGNESS OF THAT STORY
249_sheldon_solomon|HERE'S JUST INDIVIDUALS
250_brian_kernighan|YOU KNOW ALGRTHM DESIGNS AND OF NUT SMART ENOUGH SMART ENO WELL
250_david_patterson|AM SO
250_dileep_george|WHAT YOU SEE IN THE WORLD LANDING AT ALTO A FIXED FEIT FORWARD PROPAGATION
250_françois_chollet|THAT A DU CURAN TWO THOUSAND NEINETEEN
250_grant_sanderson|OF ACTUAL CITY STREETS THEY MODEL IT REALLY WELL AND NATURAL PATTERNS OF THE PEOPLE HAVE
250_jitendra_malik|SO IMEAN FOR EXAMPLE THAT THE STYLE OF COMPUTING THAT WE HAVE IN ARGIPIUS IS FAR FAR MORE POWER HUNGRY
250_joscha_bach|SO THAT'S WHERE HE FOLCUS SO MUCH ON COMMON SENSE REASONING AND SO ON AND A A PROJECT THAT WAS INSPIRED BY HIM WAS SIKE I
250_manolis_kellis|THAT HAS DRAMATICALLY CHANGED AND THE REASON THAT CHANGED IS HUMAN GENETIC
250_matt_botvinick|ERE CAPACITY LIMITED WERE NOT TURNING MACHINES OBVIOUSLY BUT
250_robert_langer|TOGETHER WORTH
250_russ_tedrake|OMINATED OUR EVOLUTINPROBABLY WAS NOT
250_sara_seager|A HA HADO THE EFELONEFAS INTERPLAY SO THESE ARE SEPARATE TERMS SEPARATE TERMS
250_sergey_levine|UM SO HAVE ANOTHER REWARD SIGNAL OF LIKE
250_steven_pressfield|ESPECIALLY WITH THE
251_dileep_george|EXAMPLES ARE EVERYWHERE WE WE SEE DISCANCE OF THINGS
251_françois_chollet|YES INKE YEH NOVEMBER
251_ian_hutchinson|SO WHERE DO WE STAND
251_karl_friston|AWHEN WE TALK ABOUT PLANA WHEN YOU TALK SPECIFICALLY ABOUT PLANNING
251_manolis_kellis|THESE SPECIES
251_matt_botvinick|WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO ADAPT BEHAVIOURS THAT ARE
251_richard_karp|YE IT'S AMEANING THAT WE CAN DORSE ANOTHER ATTRIBUTE OF GEEKS AS THEY THEY NOT NECESSARILY
252_ben_goertzel|HE HAS INK HE HAD INKLINGS I MEAN WITH FRANKENSTEIN
252_david_eagleman|HAVE TO FIND SOMETHING YOU WHAT ODER YOUR
252_grant_sanderson|A CAN WE THROUGH A LITTLE BIT OF PLAY
252_manolis_kellis|IN THE PLANET THAT'S THE MOST STARTED RIGHT NOW
252_matt_botvinick|I VERY MUCH UNLIKE ANYTHING WE'VE DONE BEFORE BUT THERE'S SOME BASIC MECHANISM AS
252_robert_langer|AM FAV PANTS MAY BE AD ISSUED PANS THAD OF WACO VERY
252_sara_seager|SO FOR EXAMPLE YOU COULD IMAGINE LIFE
252_sheldon_solomon|WRONG TO DAY IN IN MY OPINION
252_steven_pressfield|WHAT DEAL
253_david_eagleman|I WILL GI I BIOQ YAT WILL BE O K IN THE SENSE THAT I MEAN ITS GIVE ME A ROUGH TIME FOR MANY ARE MOST PEOPLE BUT
253_david_patterson|WHAT IS HAPPENING RIGHT NOW AS PEOPLE
253_grant_sanderson|A DRAW LIKE REASONABLE ISH CONCLUSIONS
253_jitendra_malik|THE EFFICIENCY PART IS A WIGOAN HAVE TO SOLVE THAT IN ORDER TO BUILD ACTUAL REAL WORLD SYSTEMS OF LARGE SCALE
253_kate_darling|AR YOU BRIN OF SOME INTERESTING IDEAS IN THA YEAR PAPER
253_manolis_kellis|IT'S EMBARRASSING TO SAY THAT BUT THIS WAS NOT THE CASE A FEW YEARS AGO OU USED TO BE YOU KNOW A FIRST VIRUSES THEN
253_matt_botvinick|IT'S IMPLEMENTED IN OUR BRAIN THAT ALLOWS US TO RUN RUN SOFTWARE
253_sergey_levine|THE CONVINCINGNESS OF THE STORY BECOMING PART OF THE REWARD FUNCTION THE OBJECTIVE FUNCTION OF THE EXPLANABILITY ITS
254_brian_kernighan|WHAT WAS THE A AI LANDSCAPE IDEAS DREAMS AT THAT TIME
254_david_patterson|ADDING ACCELERATORS TO THEIR MICROPROCESORS THAT ONLY WORK WELL FOR SOMDOMANS
254_joscha_bach|AND EVENTUALLY I THINK HE DECIDED THAT HE WAS NOT ABLE TO SOLVE IT
254_karl_friston|A BEAUTIFUL ART OF TURNTAKING
254_peter_singer|A THRAT ISELL VERY DIFFICULT FOR A TEAN AGE TO OPERATE AND
254_richard_karp|A THE MARK FOR FILLED A MET A LARGE ROOM
254_robert_langer|A LOT OF TIMES AT'S SOMEBODY IN THE LAB
254_russ_tedrake|WHAT WE SHOULD EAT NOW BECAUSE OUR ANCESTORS WERE MEETEATORS OR WHATEVER
254_sara_seager|T OUR PLANET EARWE ALREADY  HAVE A LOT OF CARBONDOXIDE ON
254_sergey_levine|IN THE WORLD OF VASERA
254_sheldon_solomon|LINK ON THE JORDAN PETERSON THING IN INTERERA
255_david_patterson|BY SHEER COINCIDENCE AT THE SAME TIME THAT THIS IS HAPPENING HAS BEEN THIS REVOLUTION IN
255_grant_sanderson|JUDGED THE VALIDITY OF A MODEL
255_ian_hutchinson|EW CLEAR ENERGIES
255_jitendra_malik|HOW WOULD YOU ARTICULATE
255_karl_friston|AND WHAT WE ARE DOING NOW
255_matt_botvinick|I'M HAPPY TO THINK OF IT AS TO SPACE AT COMPUTATION BUT MIND YOU
255_peter_singer|
255_russ_tedrake|I OUT LOVE THAT YE
255_sheldon_solomon|DISAGREEMENT IN HIS WORLD JUCY HE WENT THROUGH QUITE A BIT IT YOU KNOW THERE'S  BEEN QUITE A BIT OF FIRE RIGHT AND IN HIS
255_steven_pressfield|AS THA METAPHOR AH
256_dileep_george|U TIS COMPETITION PROCESS IT WET WE WET SO THE YEVE
256_grant_sanderson|LIKE II THINK PEOPLE SHOULD LOOK AT THAT AND THEY SHOULD CRITICISE IT THEY SHOULD POINT TO ALL THE WAYS THAT IS WRONG CAUSE IT'S DEFINITELY NAIVE RIGHT IN THE WAY THAT IT SET UP
256_ian_hutchinson|OR NUCLIER POWERS IN THE VICINITY OF AM
256_jitendra_malik|THE GENERAL PROBLEM OF COMPUTER VISION
256_russ_tedrake|BUT PROBABLY YOU KNOW THE REASON THAT
257_brian_kernighan|AND
257_ian_hutchinson|TENS OF MEGAWATZ FOUR A FEW SECONDS SO
257_joscha_bach|LANGUAGE YES
257_kate_darling|TWO THOUSAND
257_manolis_kellis|BY MINING THIS MASSIVE AMOUNT OF HUMAN DATA
257_peter_singer|VERY EASY READ EIGHTY TWO BRIEF ESSAYS ON THINGS THAT MATTER
257_richard_karp|COUJUST WALK AROUND THE INTERIOR AND A
257_sara_seager|AS BEING MADE BY LIFE VERSUS JUST BEING THERE ANYWAY
257_sheldon_solomon|A SAYNG PRETTY SIMPLE THINGS
258_ben_goertzel|BUT HE HE WASN'T
258_david_eagleman|OUR LIVES AS BEST WE CAN IT'S PREDICATED ON OUR NOTION OF O K GIVEN EVERYTHING THAT'S AROUND ME THIS IS WHAT'S POSSIBLE FOR ME NEXT WIL
258_dileep_george|A TRY TO EXPLAINT WHAT HE MEAN BY EXPLAININ A WAY
258_françois_chollet|ASKED LIKE
258_ian_hutchinson|TENN MEGAJEWELS THAT'S NOT MUCH ENERGY
258_kate_darling|THE SOLDIERS BECAME VERY EMOTIONALLY ATTACHED TO THE ROBATS M IN THATS YOUOW FINE UNTIL
258_matt_botvinick|I WANT THE HOLE
258_peter_singer|ONE OF THE ASSAYS ASKS SHOULD ROBATS HAVE RIGHTS
258_sara_seager|THEN IT'S NOT HELPFUL SO I SEPARATED THOSE TWO TERMS OUT
259_brian_kernighan|WHAT PEOPLE THOUGHT WAS JUST A FEW YEARS DOWN THE PIKE
259_françois_chollet|WELL WHAT IS INTELLIGENCE AND O HOW TO TAST FOR INTELLIGENCE SO ON SO IS THERE A SPIFFY
259_grant_sanderson|UM AS IT GOES ON AND A WHAT SAIS SOMETHING U
259_joscha_bach|EXPRESS GEOMETRY AND NOT DRAMATICAL LANGUAGES IN THE SAME SENSE SO THAT TEY VERKS THATLY DIFFERENT AND MORE GENERAL EXPRESSIONS OF FUNCTIONS
259_manolis_kellis|YOU BASICALLY HAVE IMUTATION IN ALMOST EVERY NUCLETITE
259_richard_karp|FLYING CREATURES LANDING ON THE SWITCHES
259_robert_langer|SO LHER A LOT OF THINGS YOU HAVE TO BE GOOD GOOD WITH PEOPLE GOOD MANAGER PEOPLE SO YE THE MONEY AN THE PEOPLE PART
259_sara_seager|SOON I THINK WE'LL HAVE EVIDENCE THAT
259_steven_pressfield|KIVI MOVIES ALL OF THESE THINGS THAT CREATE
260_david_eagleman|INNO NOBLE PRIZE WINNING A
260_david_patterson|IS PRETTY MUCH MULTIPLY THE MATRIX MULTIPLY IS A KEY FEATURE FOR THE WAY PEEP MACHINE THEIR NENGS DONE
260_grant_sanderson|AH ANDEMIC WHERE YOU'VE GOT LIKE A TON OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE HAD IT
260_jitendra_malik|SO FOR ALL INTELLIGENCE ARE
260_joscha_bach|AND I THINK THE GENERAL NATURE OF A MODELIST YOU HAVE A BUNCH OF PARAMETERS
260_karl_friston|ASK THE SILLIEST OR PERHAPS THE BIGGEST QUESTION AS A AS A LAST KIND OF QUESTION
260_manolis_kellis|SO EVERY NUWCLITE THAT YOU WANT TO PERTURB
260_matt_botvinick|IS THAT IS THERE SOMETHING INTERESTING TO YOURS SEARCH OF UNDERSTANDING THE HUMAN MIND
260_sergey_levine|AB CAN THE MODERN INCARNATION OF LEARNING BASE CONTROL
261_ben_goertzel|OBJECTIVE FUNCTION DRIT DRIVING HUMANS BUT BUT BUT BY ANY MEANS WOULD HE THINK A
261_brian_kernighan|SYSTEMS THAT ACTUALLY CAN LEARN FROM SOME OF THAT DAN ANTEA
261_david_eagleman|FACULTY BECOME MUTURS
261_françois_chollet|YES ULD DO YOU THINK THERE DISUPRINTED ON THE EYES OF THE FITUR WILL WANT TO REMEMBER US
261_ian_hutchinson|AND AND
261_jitendra_malik|TASKS I ALWAYS GO BACK TO SORT OF BIOLOGY OR
261_kate_darling|HAT'S YOUR FAVORITE ROBAT
261_peter_singer|RERBOTS CAPABLE OF CONSCIOUSNESS
261_richard_karp|PRACTICAL PURPOSE
262_dileep_george|A INNO EACH ONE IS DOING A DOD PRODECT AND HE CAN YOU CAN APPROXIMATE ANY FUNCTION USING THIS
262_françois_chollet|THEY WILL REMEMBER HUMENTS FROM THE BESTS AND DYOU THINK THEY WILL BE EUKNOW
262_joscha_bach|ARE DISTINCT FROM THE CONSTRAINED ARCHITECTURE OF THE BOLSMAN MACHINE ITSELF
262_karl_friston|AND A COS WER ALL GIVEN THOSE SCRIPS THOSE NARRATIVES
262_manolis_kellis|AGAIN LET ME BE HONEST WE HAVEN'T SEQUENCE OLD SEVEN BUAND PEOPLE IT'S NOT LIKE WE HAVE EVERY MUTATION BUT WE KNOW THAT THERE'S A CARRIER OUT THERE
262_peter_singer|A CAPABLE OF HAVING THEIR OWN INTERNAL
262_sara_seager|INTERESTING GAS AS THOU WOULD BE ABLE TO DETECT
263_ian_hutchinson|MAGNETIC FIELD
263_karl_friston|THEY ARE NOT ONLY
263_kate_darling|NOT LIKE NOT NOTAT TE PROMORPHIC CONNECTION BUT I MEAN LIKE A
263_manolis_kellis|IN HUMAN PSYCHOLOGY
263_matt_botvinick|ICAN'T BE DEBATED YOU KNOW ITS THE THE HUMAN BEHAVIOR ARISES WITHIN
263_peter_singer|PERSPECTIVE ON WHAT'S HAPPENING TO THEM SO THAT THEIR LIVES CAN GO WELL OR BADLY FOR THEM
263_richard_karp|ONE OF ONE OF THE EARLIER RAM
263_robert_langer|WITH OVER
263_russ_tedrake|WAR ON TURNING POINTS ABSOLUTELY AND THAT'S PROBABLY HOW
264_ben_goertzel|GOOD AND EVIL ARE
264_david_eagleman|THE WARE BRINGETS MOLDED IS BY ABSORBING EVERYTHING FROM THE WORLD ALL OF THE
264_david_patterson|EMBRACING MORE MACHINE LEARNING WE KNOW HOW TO GIVE THEM MORE PERFORMANCE EVEN AS MORSE LAW IS SLOWING DOWN AND CONRENTUTIVELY L
264_dileep_george|YOU CAN THINK OF THEM AS EACH NOT IN THAT
264_grant_sanderson|I THINK THOSE ARE UM GENERAL ENOUGH LESSONS AND THEIRE
264_ian_hutchinson|VALUES STILL VERY STRONG BUT BUT LIMITED LIMITED MAGNETIC FIELD VALUES YOU HAVE TO BUILD A VERY BIG DEVICE
264_jitendra_malik|POCEPTIAN IN A
264_manolis_kellis|IN THE EMOTIONS AND THE FEELINGS THAT WE USED TO THINK ARE
264_peter_singer|THEN RARBERT SHOULD HAVE RIVED
264_richard_karp|COMMERCIAL COMPUTERS
264_robert_langer|TEN MILLION DOLLARS IN ANUO GRANTS
264_sergey_levine|ANDSEQUENTIALLY SEMIT MA DECISIONS OF TIME AND TIME AND TIME AGAIN NOT LIKE
265_ian_hutchinson|AND SO WE ARE AT THE MOMENT
265_matt_botvinick|THAT WOULD OT EVEN LIKE
265_peter_singer|UNTIL THAT HAPPENS
265_richard_karp|THIS IS ALREADY IN THE SIXTES
265_robert_langer|AND OVER A HUNTED RESEARCHES PROBABLY OVER THOUSAND SINCE THE LABIS BEGINNING
265_russ_tedrake|AN EATING ONLY MEAT
265_sheldon_solomon|HAVE THE ANSWER
266_ben_goertzel|WE COULD DIG INTO YOUR QUESTION FROM A COUPLE DIRECTION SO I THINK
266_dileep_george|Y BEJUST TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING YOU NOWI IT CAN BE AVAILABLE REPRESENTING IS IS AN EDGE
266_grant_sanderson|HAOSES OF THE WORLD
266_ian_hutchinson|WORLED WIDE
266_jitendra_malik|THE FIRST MULTICELLULARANIMALS WHICH AROSE IN THE CAMBRIANIRA
266_joscha_bach|IF IT'S CONQOHERENT SO IF YOU SEE ATALLIAR COMING AFTER YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO SEE THIS EVEN IF IT'S UNLIKELY
266_karl_friston|EXTEL SAT OF DOING THE SAME BACK WE'RE DOING IT TOGETHER SO THATHE SYNCRANY
266_kate_darling|WOW SO TWO DIFFERENT ROBOTS SO THE
266_matt_botvinick|A THAT A I THINK IT SOMEHOW PRODUCTIVE FOR ALSO UNDERSTANDING
266_peter_singer|MOTIONED SO
266_sergey_levine|YE SEEED BIGGER THAN THAT
266_sheldon_solomon|BUT HE SAW
266_steven_pressfield|GENERATIONAL
267_françois_chollet|AH WEN WHENDE WHEN THE ROBARTS FINALLY GOT RID OF EM
267_grant_sanderson|M NOT ANOTHER WAY TO ASK I D'E THINK WE'RE ABLE TO REASON
267_ian_hutchinson|MEANS THE WAY OR JUST MEANS THE INTERNATIONAL TOCAMAC EXPERIMENTAL REACTOR IF YOU LIKE AM
267_jitendra_malik|IT O FIVE HUNDRED MILLION YEARS AGO AND A THESE ANIMALS COULD MOVE AND THEY COULD
267_joscha_bach|AND AN THE PROBABILITY IS NECESSARY FOR CONVERSIENCS OF THE MODEL SOR GIVEN THE STATE OF POSSIBILITIES
267_karl_friston|A THINGS LIKE SIR ARTHUR ENTERS SPACETIME AND GRAVITATION WHICH WAS THE THE OTHER THE FIRST
267_matt_botvinick|A AI SYSTEMS BUT A GUESS
267_sara_seager|SO WE USE CHEMISTRECAUSE WE EAT FOOD WE BREATHE AIR AND WE HAVE METABOLISM THAT
267_sergey_levine|IS IT APPLICABLE LIKE WERD WERE THE LIMITS OF THE APPLICABILITY OF REINFORCE AND LEARNING
267_sheldon_solomon|IN A GIANT MACHINE AND THAT IT WOULD CREATE
267_steven_pressfield|AMHESTASTERON
268_david_patterson|ENTHUSIASM ABOUT MACHINE LEARNING ABOUT
268_françois_chollet|I SOSELF PUBLISHED M THE DEFINITION OF INTELLIGENCE SO
268_jitendra_malik|AND THAT'S RALLY ABOUT
268_manolis_kellis|SO MANY DIFFERENT PROCESSES THAT WE PREVIOUSLY THOUGHT WERE YOU KNOW
268_richard_karp|OF MATHEMATICS
268_robert_langer|I JUST WANT
268_sheldon_solomon|AR ATENTION AND CONFLICT BETWEEN THOSE WHO OWN THINGS AND THOSE
268_steven_pressfield|ARROWS THING
269_ben_goertzel|NDIVIDUALS SELECTION
269_dileep_george|ER NORT CAN BE
269_françois_chollet|INTELLIGENCE IS DE EFFICIENCY WITH WHICH
269_jitendra_malik|AVOIDING BECOMING FOOD IF THERE'S A PREDITOR RUNNING A TANK TO
269_richard_karp|S MATHEMATICAL MACHINES ACTUALLY DOING
269_sergey_levine|AND TELLIGYR MACHINE CAN LIKELY BE REPRESENTED AS A DECISION MAKING PROBLEM
269_sheldon_solomon|WHO MADE THANKS
269_steven_pressfield|WORS NOWADAYS
270_david_eagleman|YOU NEE A CARRY NEE TO BE CURIOUS ABOUT SOMETHING
270_david_patterson|MOST PERGRAMMING IS DONE IN THE WAY ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENT IS TO BE DONE THAT'S A MOVEMENT THAT
270_joscha_bach|BY THE THE THE SPACE OF FA THE SPACE OF IDEAS THAT A COHERENT
270_kate_darling|AND WAS THE SECOND ROBOT THAT YOU WERE AH YOU SAID THERE MIGHT A BEEN TO THAT YOU LIKED
270_manolis_kellis|SLICES SO MUCH ON THAT POINT HOW MUCH FREEDOM DO YOU THINK WE HAVE TO ESCAPE THE
270_peter_singer|AND IF SO
270_robert_langer|EUNOPER IT CONERUNS ITSELF
270_russ_tedrake|PROBABLY IT WAS
270_sara_seager|THEN ULTIMATELY TO USE
270_steven_pressfield|DON'T KNOW IV BEEN
271_brian_kernighan|COMPUTING BEING EVERYWHERE OR A YOU WORRIED
271_david_eagleman|A WORLD VIEW WITHIN THIS NEW
271_david_patterson|FOR GOING ON AT THE SAME TIME COINCIDENTALLY
271_dileep_george|O WULL OR NOT AN AN THEN SO ITKEN IT IS
271_jitendra_malik|AT THE FUNDAMENT A LEVIL CONNECT PERCEPTION TO ACTIO
271_matt_botvinick|THERE ARE BASIC PHENOMENA THAT YOU U OUTO THE BASIC ASPECTS OF HUMAN INTELLIGENCE THAT
271_peter_singer|WHAT IS CAUSCIOUSNESS
271_richard_karp|BUT THE GIDRAWNY INSPIRATIONS OF
271_russ_tedrake|RANDOM EVENTS
271_sara_seager|AND ALL LIFE HERE HAS SOME KIND OF BY PRODUCT AND IN DOING ALL THAT SOME KIND OF WASTE PRODUCT THAT GOES INTO THE ATMOSPHERE SO
271_sergey_levine|AND ONE OF THE REALLY APPEALING THINGS ABOUT REINFORCEMENT LEARNING IS
271_steven_pressfield|IT'S HARD TO SAY THERE'S NOT GOT A BE INOTHER WAR BECAUSE THERE ALWAYS ARE
272_ben_goertzel|HAS DRIVEN US IN THA SELFISH DEONAY SORT OF WAY SSO THAT
272_david_patterson|THE IDEA
272_françois_chollet|RIGHT SO IT IS NOT
272_kate_darling|HAVE YOU MET THEM IN PERSON
272_matt_botvinick|UNO CAN ONLY BE UNDERSTOOD IN IN THE CONTEXT OF
272_richard_karp|COULD YOU HAVE IMAGINED
273_ian_hutchinson|REACT REACTION
273_karl_friston|PORT ON PATRION
273_manolis_kellis|BECAUSE I CHOOSE NOT TO
273_matt_botvinick|GROUPS I I'M PERFECTLY OPEN TO THAT I'VE NEVER BEEN PARTICULARLY
273_robert_langer|THEY'LL FEEL GOOABT
273_sara_seager|LIKE ALET'S IMAGINE LIKE A WINDMILL LIKE MECHANICAL ENERGY
273_sergey_levine|BUT WHAT WWHAT O US THE FUNDAMENTAL DIFFERENCE BETWEEN REENFORCEMENT LEARNING AND MAYBE SUPERVISED MACHINE LEARNING  MA
274_ben_goertzel|HUMANS IN A WAY WILL DO WHAT
274_david_eagleman|FROM THE HUMAN
274_dileep_george|A DU INFERENCE IN THE RIGHT FARE YOU KNOW HOW WHAT IS THE BEST WAY TO
274_françois_chollet|WHAT YOU KNOW IT'S NOT WHAT YOU CAN DO IT'S HAL WELL AND HIGH EFFICIENTLY YOU CAN REARN
274_grant_sanderson|OUR INSTINCT IS USUALLY TO SAY FIVE THAT'S THE NUMBER THAT SITS RIGHT BETWEEN ONE AND NINE A BUT SOMETIMES WIN A NUMEROUSY AND
274_ian_hutchinson|FOR YOUNOW LONG TIME TIME PERIODS AT EXCITING D'U
274_jitendra_malik|BECAUSE IT'S HAVE MANY MORE PURPOSES
274_manolis_kellis|BUT THERE ARE CHEMICAL RECEPTORS THAT MADE ME NOT RESIST THE URGE
274_matt_botvinick|CONVINCED BY THE NOTION THAT
274_richard_karp|THERE WAS A SENSE IN THE LABORATORY
274_robert_langer|THEY'LL FEEL GOOD ABOUT THEMSELVES AND THEY'LL BE HAPP
274_sergey_levine|REENFORCEMENT LEARNING CAN BE VIEWED AS A GENERALIZATION OF SUPERVISED MACHINE LEARN
275_ben_goertzel|AND YOU CAN SEE SAYINT AUNT COLNEY OR BEEHIVE
275_grant_sanderson|THE KIND OF JUST BASIC ARISTHMETIC THAT WE HAVE ISN'T IN A SOCIETY THE NATURAL INSTINCT IS THREE
275_joscha_bach|EVERY INURIN IS A SINGLE CELLED ORGANISM THAT IS QUITE COMPLICATED AND IN SOME SENSE QUITE MORTIVATED TO GET FET
275_richard_karp|THAT THIS WAS THE WAVE OF THE FUTURE
275_robert_langer|BUT THROUGH BRAIN STORMING AND SO ON WHAT WHAT'S YOUR ROLL AND HOW DIFFICULT IT IS AS A GROUP
275_sheldon_solomon|IN ORDER TO FLATTEN THE CURVE
276_dileep_george|UM AND THEN
276_françois_chollet|YES SO YOU WOULD SEE INTELLIGENCE UNDISPLAY FOR INSTANCE
276_grant_sanderson|BECAUSE IT'S
276_jitendra_malik|WHAT SEEMS LIKE A FAIRLY GENERAL PARPA'S CAPABILITY
276_joscha_bach|AND IT GETS FET IF IT FIRES ON AVERAGE AT THE RIGHT TIME
276_manolis_kellis|WHO MAY HAVE ACTUALLY BEEN DRIVEN BY OTHER THINGS THAT YOU ACTUALLY ARE NOT CHOOSING
276_peter_singer|THAT'S CAPABLE OF EXPERIENCING PLEASURE
276_sara_seager|SO WE MAKE THIS BASE ANSUMPTION OF CHEMISTRY THAT'S THE FIRST THING
276_sheldon_solomon|OF ECONOMIC DESTRUCTION TO PUT THAT IN PLAINER ENGLISH O I
276_steven_pressfield|HATEFUL ON
277_david_eagleman|HOW MUCH IS THE WHOLE THING
277_françois_chollet|AH WHENEVER YOU SEE
277_grant_sanderson|AH IN BETWEEN IN AN EXPINENTIAL SENSE AND A GEOMETRIC SENSE THAT
277_ian_hutchinson|I HAVE TO ADMIT THOUGH
277_joscha_bach|MAKING  A HYPOTHESIS WHEN IT SENDS A SIGNAL AND
277_richard_karp|ANTICIPATION THAT WE WOULD BE WALKING AROUND WITH COMPUTERS IN OUR POCKETS OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT
277_robert_langer|THAT MIGHT HAVE INPACKED
277_russ_tedrake|I WOULDN'T HAVE I EVER TRIED TO CONVINCE YOU THAT AND YOU SHOULD START A COMPANY AROUND BIPEDS OR SOMETHING LIKE THIS
277_sara_seager|BY ULTR VIOLET RADIATION
277_sergey_levine|THEY'RE FUNDAMENTALLY D THAT'S A MATHEMATICAL STATEMENT AS ABSOLUTELY CORRECT BUT
278_brian_kernighan|THE EXPINENTIAL IMPROVEMENT OF SYSTEMS
278_david_eagleman|I PREDETERMINE
278_grant_sanderson|ONE IS THREE TIMES BIGGER AND THE THE NEXT ONE IS THREE TIMES BIGGER THAN THAT S I'S LIKE WHAT'S
278_jitendra_malik|MORTAL OF THE EXTERNAL WILE INSIDE THE HEAD
278_joscha_bach|IAZO BECAUSE OF THE BRAIN IS TA MEDOL LEARNING SYSTEM
278_kate_darling|THE CRAP OUT OF IT
278_matt_botvinick|I THINK A SERIOUS
278_robert_langer|AND I MEAN YOU'VE KIND HAV MENTIONED IT HAPPINESS BUT A
278_sergey_levine|IT SEEMS THAT REINFORCEMENT LEARNING THE KIND OF TOOLS WILL BRING TO THE TABLE TO DAY IF TO DAY SO MAY BE DOWN THE LINE
278_steven_pressfield|TWO MENTAL SPHERES HAPPENING AT THE SAME TIME
279_david_patterson|A IT WAS SLOTHWORE HARDWARE T WAS THE COMPILERS
279_dileep_george|HER SAY FIFTY PERCENT PROBABLITY THAT THERE IS AN EDGE HERE IN THIS PAT OF THE MODEL
279_grant_sanderson|FOR SOME REASON WE KIND OF TRAINED IT OUT OF OURSELVES TO START THINKING ENEEARLY ABOUT THINGS SO IN THE SENSE HE HADD THAT EARLY
279_richard_karp|OTHER COMMUNITY OF DREAMERS YAH AS SOMETHING THAT COULD ONE DAY HAVE HUMAN LEVEL INTELLIGENCE
279_robert_langer|IS THERE SOMETHING MORE HOW DO YOU INSPIRE A RESEARCH OR TO DO THE BEST WORK OF THEIR LIFE SEE YO MENTIONED
279_sergey_levine|SUPERVISE LEARNING HAS BEEN USED VERY EFFECTUAVLY TO SOLVE
279_steven_pressfield|AND I DON'T KNOW HOW THAT
280_david_patterson|LIKE A PIE TORCH IN A TENSER FLO
280_françois_chollet|CAPTUREUS AA DISIDEA WHICH IS THE MEASURE OF INTELLIGENCE
280_ian_hutchinson|EXPERIMENT AND SO IT WON'T EVEN COME INTO OPERATION UNTIL ABOUT TWENTY TWENTY FIVE EVEN THOUGH IT'S BEEN BEING BUILT FOR
280_jitendra_malik|PSYCHOLOGISTS HAVE GREAT FUN IN POINTING OUT THE WAYS IN WHICH THE MODEL IN YOUR HEAD IS NOT
280_kate_darling|IAM IT REALLY HARD FOR ANYONE TO WATCH SPOT MOVE AND NOT FEEL LIKE IT HAS AGENCY YEA BE THSMO ESPECIALLY THE ARM
280_matt_botvinick|AND MAY BE TO
280_russ_tedrake|YOU KNOW HAVING A HUMAN FORM IS A PRETTY GOOD WAY TO GO
280_sara_seager|I GUESS IT WAS SHULD PAUSE ON THAT THAT
280_sergey_levine|BASIC NARROW A I PROBLEMS REANFORCE OME LEARNING KINDO REPRESENTS
280_steven_pressfield|HOW THE POPULACE WOULD RESPOND DIFFERENT THAN THEY DID IN PREVIOUS GENERITION YET I THINK THEY CERTAINLY WOULD YE
281_brian_kernighan|THE PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES WILL CHANGE WITH THIS INCREASE WHETHER WE HIT A WALL OR NOT WHAT DO YOU THINK
281_david_patterson|WERE THE MOST TOPTIMIZATION ME YE  AND SUDDEN AND SO
281_françois_chollet|IS THE ABIDITY TO CHENCE
281_jitendra_malik|PERFECT MODEL OF THEIR EXTERNAL VOTE
281_robert_langer|INSPIRE THE RESEARCHES THROUGH THE
281_sergey_levine|THE DREAM OF A A IT'S A VERY MUCH SO IN THE RESEARCH SPACE NOW
281_sheldon_solomon|UP FOR THE PROVISION
282_ben_goertzel|THT THAT THAT THAT'S IT THAT'S A DIFFERENT THING ARE THOSE A EXCEPTIONS BELL I IE ON TEYE BUT I I THINK I AT COR
282_david_patterson|THEY CAME UP WITH MACHINE LEARNING ACCELERATORS
282_dileep_george|USED TO REPRESENT CAUSALITY IN THE WORLD
282_grant_sanderson|IT'S IT'S THE SAME CRITICISM IF THERE'S ANY OF SCIENCE IS THE LESSONS OF SCIENCE
282_joscha_bach|GOVERNMENT THAT TELLS YOU HERE'S A LOSS FUNCTION HERE'S A LOSS FUNCTION HERE'S A LSS FUNCTION LIKE WHAT DO
282_manolis_kellis|IS THAT BECAUSE THE SYSTEM IS TRULY FREE
282_peter_singer|TAKING THINGS IN
282_richard_karp|THE ASATE  THE TONTESQUE CONCLUDING AN INTELLIGENCE THE AATURING TEST
282_robert_langer|IN A PRETTY DIFFICULT PROCESS OF
282_sergey_levine|INS OF CAPTIVATING THE IMAGINATION OF PEOPLE OF WHAT WE CAN DO WITH INTELLIGIOUS SYSTEMS BUT HE HASN'T YET HAD
282_sheldon_solomon|WITH A PHILOSOPHY I SHULD YOU SHOULD
283_david_patterson|THAT THEY HAD GOOD AMIL PERF SCORES A
283_ian_hutchinson|LOOK I ABSOLUTELY THINK THAT FUSION RESEARCH IS
283_kate_darling|JUST A BASIC MOVEMENT PLATFORM
283_manolis_kellis|WHEN I LOOK AT WEATHER BATTERS I CAN PREDICT THE NEXT TEN DAYS
283_richard_karp|UM WOULD YOU THINK ABOUT THAT PAPER WAS THAT JUST LIKE SCIEN'ED FICTION
283_robert_langer|GOING FROM IDEA TO
283_russ_tedrake|YOU KNOW AT SOME POINT IN THE LONG RUN WE'LL BE BUILDING OUR ENVIRONMENTS FOR OUR RHOBOTS PROBABLY AND SO MAYBE THAT ARGUMENT FALLS ASIDE
283_sheldon_solomon|POPULAR THE TALKING HEADS THESE DAYS WHO SPEW MARKSEST WORDS
284_ben_goertzel|A MIX AND NUTS
284_dileep_george|OR ALAME OR THE O AD HOME
284_françois_chollet|AND CLEVER
284_matt_botvinick|THE THE COGNIZING SYSTEM WHETHER IT'S A BRAIN OR NAI SYSTEM UM
284_sara_seager|YOU KNOW A IF FEEL LIKE THERE IS NO TOOL TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION
284_sergey_levine|IKE WHAT D'YOU SEE IS THA
285_ben_goertzel|THAT'S THE NATURE OF IT AND WE ALSO HAVE
285_brian_kernighan|THAT IS IN MANY CASES AT THIS POINT DOMAIN OF OF SPECIALIZED LANGUAGES FOR NARROW DOMAINS
285_ian_hutchinson|BUT IT ISN'T GOING TO BE
285_jitendra_malik|AN ANIMAL FIVE HUNDRED MILLION YEARS AGO
285_joscha_bach|SO AVITU RONOME
285_kate_darling|WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ABOUT TE SOPHYA THE ROBOT THIS KIND OF
285_russ_tedrake|OH DO YOU STILL RUN BAREFOOT I STILL RUN BAREFOOT THAT'S SO AWE SOME
285_sergey_levine|GAP BETWEEN THE MORE GENERAL REFORSE THE LEARNING
285_steven_pressfield|AND A I'M A SWORD
286_ben_goertzel|CONSTELLATION OF VALUES THAT ARE JUST
286_brian_kernighan|OR PROGRAMMES OR SOMETHING WE'LL FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO WHAT I WANTED DO
286_david_patterson|A EN ANA DIDN'T EXIST EVEN TWO YEARS AGO
286_françois_chollet|ABILLY TO DEAL WITH NEW THINGS VERSES ABILITY TO JS
286_grant_sanderson|BUT THAT YOU CAN BASICALLY TRAIN INTO PEOPLE LIK I THINK COMPUTER SCIENTISTS AND PHYSICISTS WHEN THEYARE LOOKING AT THE EARLY NUMBERS OF
286_ian_hutchinson|A MAGIC BULLET THAT SOMEHOW
286_jitendra_malik|SIMULTANEOUSLY
286_joscha_bach|NINETY NINE PER CENT OF THE DETAILS OF THIS METO LEARNING SYSTEM THAT'S OUR MIND OCE
286_kate_darling|MIX OF SOME BASIC NATURAL LANGUISH PROCESSING AND
286_matt_botvinick|COGNITION IS REALLY
286_richard_karp|RETURNING TO THIS EMOTIONAL MASS THAT IS INTELLIGENCE YEU THINK IT'S POSSIBLE TO COME UP WITH A TEST
286_robert_langer|BY TALKING TO PEOPLE GOING OVER
286_sara_seager|IS THIS COOL IDEA
286_sergey_levine|ND THE VERY SPECIFIC
286_steven_pressfield|'LL TELL YOU ONE ALANIC DOT
287_david_patterson|ONE OF THE COOL THINGS THAT I ENJOY BUT IN ANET HAS A FEW DOWNSIDES BUT ONE OF THE NICE THINGS IS THE
287_dileep_george|WOT BOTKEN BECAUSUS OF
287_grant_sanderson|COVID WERE
287_joscha_bach|BUT STILL WE TOOK A LEAP FROM SOMETHING MUCH DUMBER
287_kate_darling|A BASIC IN ARCT EXPERIMENT YEM
287_manolis_kellis|IN THE SAME WAY IF YOU TAKE A COMPLETE VIEW OF A HUMAN BEING NOW
287_steven_pressfield|THERE WAS A
288_brian_kernighan|AND ONE DAY GETTING TO THE HUMAN LEVEL
288_peter_singer|A GOOD WILL GIVES ME THE DIRECTIONS
288_robert_langer|KEEP PUSHING AND
288_steven_pressfield|WAS
289_ben_goertzel|ARTICULARITIES TWO
289_brian_kernighan|PROGRAMMING TO NON MAJORS
289_david_patterson|ARE YOU REALLY A
289_dileep_george|YOU YOU' DRAT IT YOU KNOWY BUT YOU'RE IN YOUR OFFICE YOU HEARD BUGGLAR ALLI'M GOING OFF
289_françois_chollet|U THINK THERE'S SOMETHING TO THAT
289_ian_hutchinson|BY CONTRAST FISH AND ENERGY
289_kate_darling|CANA IMMEDIATE HAD A CONNECTION AND THOUGHT THAT IT MAY BE WERT FAR FAR MORE ADVANCED WITH RABOTICS THAN WE ARE OR ACTUALLY DIDN'T EVEN THINK MUCH
289_manolis_kellis|THE QUESTION IS CAN I PREDICT YOUR NEXT STEP PROBABLY
289_richard_karp|HUMAN LEVEREL LEVEL INTELLIGENCE
289_robert_langer|AND SO FORTH BUT DOWN
289_sergey_levine|A IT'S A LITTLE BIT TOUGH TO JUST DEPLOY SOME POLICY THAT DOES CRAZY STUFF AND LEARNS PURELY THROUGH TRALANAIR
289_sheldon_solomon|BABIES BEFORE THEY CAN WALK AND TALK
289_steven_pressfield|CONSIDERED LESS THAN
290_ben_goertzel|AM IN VALUES WHICH
290_david_eagleman|FOUR CHILDREN BROADLY ABECAUSE THESE FORMED OF YEARS MATTERS SO MUCH
290_dileep_george|YOU ARE HEADING OUR HOME
290_ian_hutchinson|FICIENT TO BUILD A FISH IND REACTOR PROVE TO BE AMAZINGLY EASY
290_jitendra_malik|WE CAN SAY THAT THE THE GENERAL PROLEM OF COMPUTER VISION
290_joscha_bach|ANDA IS THERE SOMETHING WE CAN THINK ABOUT
290_matt_botvinick|O AT LEAST IN THAT CONTEXT IF WE CAN STEP BACK INTO ANOTHER TS OF BEAUTIFUL WORLD WHICH IS THE ACTUAL
290_peter_singer|A CERTAIN I I IS OR ISN'T CONSCIOUS IT MAY MIMIC CONSCIOUSNESS AND WE CAN'T TELL IF IT'S ONY MIMICING IT OR IF IT'S THE REAL THING
290_richard_karp|RIGHT SO THAT'S SOPHER SOLEMY AT THE PHILOSOPHICALL DO YOU THINK IT'S POSSIBLE TO CREATE
290_sergey_levine|IT'S MUCH EASIER TO COLLECT
290_sheldon_solomon|WILL RECIPROCA
291_ben_goertzel|ONE OF OUR A I DEVELOPMENT OFFICES FOM MY SINGULARITY O PROJEC
291_brian_kernighan|JUST FROM THAT EXPERIENCE WHAT ADVICE TY HAVE FOR PEOPLE WHO DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT PROGRAMMING
291_david_eagleman|SO IS THERE FREE WILL
291_ian_hutchinson|HOW TO BUILD HE REACTOR AND DID SO
291_joscha_bach|ABOUT THE  AS WE START TO THINK ABOUT HOW TO ENGENEER INTELLIGENCE IS THERE SOMETHING WE CAN LEARN FROM EVOLUTION
291_kate_darling|THE THAT THEY KIND OF ASSUMED
291_russ_tedrake|WALKING ROBETT'S COMMUNITY
291_steven_pressfield|AND DAH NOT THAT WE COULD NOT NOT THAT'S THE POINT A
292_ben_goertzel|WHEN I WALKED THROUGH THE STREETS AN ADIS O THERE'S SO THERE'S PEOPLE
292_brian_kernighan|WHAT PROGRAMMING IS HOW YOU WRITE A PROGRAMME UM AND HOW COMPUTERS TALK TO EACH OTHER
292_david_patterson|IN IS AUTONIMOUS VEHICLES AN THEARE STILL
292_joscha_bach|AND THIS FUNCTION IS NOT IMPLEMENTED AS SOME KIND OF SUPERNATURAL THING
292_kate_darling|THAT WELL OF COURSE A I CAN DO THIS
292_robert_langer|AN MI TE
292_sergey_levine|AND THEN MAYBE YOU NOW IF YOU CAN GET A GOOD PULSE OUT OF THAT THEN YOU DEPLOYIT AND LET IT KIND AF FIND TUNE A LITTLE B
292_sheldon_solomon|LOOK LIKE I'M TRYING TO GIVE IT TO THE BABY
293_brian_kernighan|AND WHAT DO THEY DO WHEN THEY'RE TALKING TO EACH OTHER AND THEN
293_david_eagleman|WWE CAN'T REALLY THINK
293_david_patterson|BETCHMARKS IR
293_dileep_george|OUR A BUGLAR GETTING INTO THEIR HOUSE IS DIMINISHED
293_françois_chollet|YOU I VALTERE THAT I EFFICIENTLY O WOLT TO
293_jitendra_malik|THE PROBLEM OF COMPUTI VISION
293_robert_langer|AND YET TO HAVE AT LEAST I MY
293_sara_seager|AND YOU KNOW WE RELY ONT OXYGEN TO BREATHE YOU KNOW WHEN THEY O HEAR ABOUT THE PEOPLE OF MOUNT EVERICE RUNNING OUT OF AIR
293_sergey_levine|BUT ALGARYTHMICALLY IT'S QUITE DIFFICULT TO DO THAT
293_steven_pressfield|WE TALK ABOUT THE REAL THE BLOODY CONFLICTS THE'VE WRITTEN ABOUT MANY OF THEM M
294_david_eagleman|OF HOW YOU WOULD GET FREE WOLLN THERE BECAUSE AS FAR AS WE CAN TELL ITS THE MACHINE IT'S A VERY COMPLICATED MACHINE
294_françois_chollet|A INTELLIGENCE WHICH IS A PROCESS AND THE ATPUT OF THAT PROCESS WHICH IS KILL
294_grant_sanderson|GAME OVER YOU KNOW THE OTHER CLASSIC EXAMPLE FOR I'M GAGING SOMEONE'S INTUITIVE UNDERSTANDING OF EXPINENTIAL GROWTH IS A I'VE GOT LIKE A LILY PAD
294_ian_hutchinson|ALL THAT LONG
294_kate_darling|I FELT THEY SHOULD BE MORE IMPRESSED
294_matt_botvinick|AREA OF EXPERTISE IF I HAVE ONE
294_peter_singer|FROM THAT PROSPECTIVE
294_russ_tedrake|SO I I DID EVENTUALLY READ BORN TO RUN MOST PEOPLE READ BORN DO RUN IN THE EARTH THERE RIGHT AM
294_sara_seager|HEY'RE REALLY RUNNING OUT OF OXYGE WHILE HEY'RE UNNING OUT OF OXYGEN CAUSE THE AIR IS GETTING THINNER
294_steven_pressfield|ASK A PERSONAL QUESTION
295_brian_kernighan|BRANCH AND SO ON AS YOU MENTIONED EARLIER A
295_david_eagleman|AND THEREORE IF THERE'S NOTHING IN IT THAT'S NOT BEING DRIVEN BY SOMETHING ELSE THEN IT SEEMS IT'S HARD TO
295_dileep_george|IF YEF YOU THINK OF WHAT BEST TOO CAUSES EXPLAINING IT OVERTHE LE A AVALUABLE WHICH IS
295_françois_chollet|AM
295_kate_darling|R LITTLE BUT INFLUENCE BY SCIENCE FICTION N POP CULTURE TO THINK THAT WE SHOULD BE FURTHER ALONG THAN WE ARE
295_matt_botvinick|IS OM PREFONDAL QUARTAX
295_richard_karp|IT SEEMS TO ME THAT IM
295_robert_langer|THAT YEU HOPE WILL PERSIST HOW DOESN IT YE TO CHANGE
295_sara_seager|THEY CLIMB UP THE MOUNTAIN
296_ben_goertzel|WHEN I COME BACK HOME TO THE DEVELOPED WORLD
296_brian_kernighan|WRITE THE CODE AND LESS DEPENDENT ON PARTICULAR ARCHITECTURES ON
296_ian_hutchinson|AM SO
296_manolis_kellis|A YURE
296_richard_karp|MOST OF THE ACHIEVEMENTS HAVE
296_robert_langer|WHAT NEEDS TO STAY THE SAME WHAT ARE ARE JIST THOUGHTS IN THIS WHOLE ANSCYPE OF SCIENCE AND ITS FUTURE
296_sheldon_solomon|WILL RCIPROCATE
297_brian_kernighan|COMPUTERS OR MAYBE WINDOWS AND THEIR DOWNLOADING APS ON THEIR PHONES AND ALL THOSE THINGS ARE PROGRAMMES THAT ARE JUST
297_dileep_george|INCREASING THE EVIDENCE FOR SOME CAUSE EX INO THERE IS EVIDENCE COMING IN FROM BELOW FOR ALARM BEING PRESENT
297_grant_sanderson|ONE DAY AND THEN IT DOUBLES THE NEXT DAY N IND DOUBLES THE NEXT DAY
297_joscha_bach|THINK IT'S A LARDED TERM BECAUSE IT'S FROM A PRESCANTIFIC AGE
297_kate_darling|WHAT WOULD HE LIKE ABOUT WALLI THE HUMOUR THE CUTENESS
297_manolis_kellis|EXPRETISE AND COMPUTERS
297_matt_botvinick|PARTS OF YOUR BRAIN THAT ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR MOTOR BEHAVIOR AND THEY'RE VERY EASY TO IDENTIFY AM AND
297_richard_karp|QUIRE OPERATE WITHIN A VERY LIMITED SET OF GROUND RULES AND FOR A VERY LIMITED PRECISE TASK
297_robert_langer|I I THINK FROM ANARCODEMIC STANDPOINT
298_ben_goertzel|SPENT SOME ON THE LIMITED MONEY I HAVE
298_david_eagleman|AND  NOW IM A FAN OF THE HISTORY OF SCIENCE AN WHAT THE THING THAT ALWAYS STRIKES ME AS INTERESTING AS WHEN YOU LOOK
298_david_patterson|WHEN YOU ENTER THE WORLD TO BENCH MARKS YOU CT YOU HAVE TO BE GOOD TO PARTICIPATE AS TE POST TO A
298_dileep_george|AND IN ITIAL IT WAS FLOWING TO
298_ian_hutchinson|OBVIOUSLY
298_joscha_bach|RIGHT THERE NEEDS TO BE A CERTAIN LEVEL AT WHICH WE CAN EXIST AS A SPECIES IF HE WANT TO ENDURE
298_matt_botvinick|THE REGION OF YOUR CEREBRAL CARTAX THE OUT NEAT THE SORT OF OUTER
299_ben_goertzel|DOES THAT MAKE ME EVIL
299_ian_hutchinson|TO MEET THE
299_joscha_bach|AND SINCE WE ARE NOT ABLE TO DO THAT AS IT SEEMS A THIS CULTURA WILL DIE
299_matt_botvinick|CRUST OF YOUR BRAIN THAT LIES IN FRONT OF THOSE
299_sergey_levine|CAN YOU MABE PAINT THE PICTURE OF THE DIFFERENT METHODS SHE SAID TO  OFF POLICY
299_steven_pressfield|OF COURSE ONE NEVER KNOWS I CERTAINLY I HAVE NOT BEEN IN COMBAT I HAVEN'T KILLED ANYBODY
300_françois_chollet|INOWAM IT'S POSSIBLE THAT THEREIS SOMETHING MORE FUNDAMENTAL THANAS HUMANS
300_ian_hutchinson|ENERGY CHALLENGES OF OUR AGE IT IS COMPLETELY
300_manolis_kellis|IS THAT I USE COMPUTER SCIENCE TO UNDERSTAND BIOLOGY
300_peter_singer|WHAT IF ROBATS
300_richard_karp|CHANGING ENVIRONMENTS
300_robert_langer|SUPERDIRECTED
300_russ_tedrake|I'M A BIG FAN OF IT FOR ME BUT I'M NOT GOIN
300_steven_pressfield|BUT I WOULD IMAGINE
301_ben_goertzel|YA IY AY I HAVE
301_david_eagleman|I ASK YOU TO SPECULATE WORD DO YOU THINK
301_dileep_george|IT EXPLAINS EVETHIS EVIDENCE AND IT EVIDENCE WILL NOW FLOATED OTHER CAUSE
301_jitendra_malik|BUT WE V
301_joscha_bach|TNOT WEAR UP TO MISTER THINKE EE E E YES I SO YET YOU C HAVE THIS KOND OF INTUITION THAT
301_manolis_kellis|I DEVELOP METHODS IN A EYE AND MACHINE LEARNING STATISTICS IN NALGRYDMS ET CETERA
301_matt_botvinick|SORT OF THE GEOGRAPHIC REGION YOU A SUPPOSED TO SOME KIND OF FUNCTIONAL DEFINITION EXACTLY SO
301_sara_seager|O QEB HOW DO YOU DETECT THAT TYPE OF GASES THAT ARE ON THE PLANET
302_ben_goertzel|GENERSIANS
302_brian_kernighan|TOI ASSEMBLY LANGUAGE THING THAT ADDS TWO OR THREE NUMBERS TO KNOW SOMETHING THAT
302_dileep_george|AS ANCORDING AIR
302_ian_hutchinson|OR SEO TO EMISSIONS FREE
302_joscha_bach|OUR CIVILIZATION YOU SAY CULTURE BUT YOU REALLY MEAN
302_kate_darling|THINGS IKE OLLECTS ARE IN THE HOME
302_peter_singer|AND EVEN WHEN I MYSELF PROGRAMMED IT IN
302_richard_karp|AM
302_robert_langer|I THINK THAT'S PROBABLY THE NUMBER ONE THING BY
302_steven_pressfield|THAT IT WOULD CHANGE YOU
303_ian_hutchinson|AND IN FACT THE WASTES THAT COME FROM NEWCLEAR POWER WHETHER ITS FISH AND OR FUSION FOR THAT MATTER ARE SO
303_jitendra_malik|HYPER I IV YOU HYPEDYWALDED OUR VIDUAL SYSTEM EXTUALLYJUST TO ASIE TO INTERRUPT BUT
303_matt_botvinick|IT OCCUPIES THE THING IN THE FRONT OF THE ET EXACTLY AND AND IN FACT
303_peter_singer|JUST HAVING AN OTHER ENTITY THAT'S NOW FOR THE MOMENT DISJOINED FOR ME SHOWING SIGNS OF PAIN
303_robert_langer|SO AGAIN YE VERY SUCCESSFUL
303_russ_tedrake|IT'S ALL ABOUT THE LONG TERM GAME RIGHT SO I THINK IT'S JUST TOO EASY TO RUN TEN MILES FEEL PRETTY GOOD
303_sara_seager|WHEN I FIRST STARTED WORKING ON EXO PLANETS LONG TIME AGO
304_ben_goertzel|E THINKS POSSIBLE THATS KIND OF AN EMERGENT
304_brian_kernighan|IF YOU LOOK AT THE BROAD AND BROAD STROKES OT HISTORY
304_françois_chollet|THERE COULD BE SOMETHING LIKE HE COULD ARGUE THE UNIVERSE
304_ian_hutchinson|MODERATE IN QUANTITY
304_peter_singer|MAKES ME FEEL IKE IT IS CONSCIOUS
304_richard_karp|AH THEY HAVE INTURITION THEY HAVE DESIRES
304_robert_langer|BUT YOU STILL FEEL THE PRESSURE OF THAT
305_ben_goertzel|PHEMENA PHENOMEN THOSE PECULIARITIES OF OUR VALUE SYSTEM
305_david_patterson|AH YOU KNOW I ACTUALLY UNO QUANUM COMPUTING A HIS IDEAS BEEN AROUND FOR A WHILE AND I ACTUALLY THOUGHT WELL SURE HOPE
305_dileep_george|AM IS AN EDGEPRECENT OR NO
305_françois_chollet|IS MORE INTELLIGENT LIKE THE THE DEEP
305_grant_sanderson|LIKE AFTER FORTY NINE DAYS YOU'VE ONLY COVERED HALF OF IT
305_kate_darling|I CAN PRETTY MUCH GUARANTEE YOU WITHOUT HAVING ANY KNOWLEDGE
305_robert_langer|OF HAVING TO SEEK FUNDING
305_russ_tedrake|AS IF YOU HIT HARD WITH YOUR FOOT
305_sergey_levine|TAKE THIS ACTION THAT I HADN'T TAKEN BEFORE
305_sheldon_solomon|GET BATS RECIPROCATE
305_steven_pressfield|HE CAN'T HELP BUT
306_ben_goertzel|HOW MUCH OF IT IS INNATE
306_david_patterson|I RETIRED BEFORE I HAVE TOSTART TEACHIN THIS II'D SAY BECAUSE I TALK ABOUT GIVE THESE TALKS ABOUT THE SLOWING OF MORS LAW
306_grant_sanderson|UMH YET I MEAN THAT'S THE REASON YOU HEARD A PAUSE FROM ME
306_jitendra_malik|BET CERTAINLY WITH RESPECT TO E
306_peter_singer|WHERE GUAMAPS AND ROPE RUMBAS ARE PRETENDING TO BE CONSCIOUS
306_richard_karp|I DON'T SEE ANYTHING IN THE CURRENT ACHIEVEMENTS OF WHAT'S CALLED EH AI
306_sheldon_solomon|SO LIKE YOU PUT IT EARLIER LEX
307_brian_kernighan|ARE YOU EXCITED BY THE FUTURE THE NEXT TEN TWENTY YEARS THE COMPUTING
307_david_eagleman|TAKE OUT SOME WIRES
307_kate_darling|WOO BUT EVEN JUST LIKE
307_peter_singer|THE SENTENTS OF APES ARE NOT SMART ENOUGH TO REALIZE OR NOT
307_sheldon_solomon|ON ONM FORSELF A FOR OURSELVE DOST INTURES YO NOW BUT ARIGHT SO BUT BACK TO ANAM SMITH FOR SECOND LAXIS LIK
308_brian_kernighan|OU YOU WERE THERE WHEN THERE WAS NO COMPUTER'S REAL
308_david_patterson|AH THA THOSE TWO REPORTS TO ME SAY PROBABLY IT'LL  BE TWENTY THIRTY BEFORE QUANA COMPUTING IS THE
308_françois_chollet|HUMAN SAR CAPLE OF HANDLING A A SITUATIONS AND TASKS THATS
308_manolis_kellis|TO TRULY UNDERSTAND
308_matt_botvinick|STARTED PEOPLE DOWN THIS ROAD OF TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE BRAIN
308_peter_singer|THEN WE REALIZE
308_richard_karp|PUTER PROGRAMME
308_sara_seager|THE FIRST EXEL PLANTET AROUND A SUNLIKE STAR ANYWAY WAS DETECTED IN THE MIDNINETEEN NINETIES OWS A BIG DEL
309_ben_goertzel|INDIVIDUAL AND GROUP SELECTION LEADING TO A MIX OF SELFISHNESS AND ALTRAISM ON THE OTHER HAND
309_brian_kernighan|ONE THAT MADE YOU TRULY HAPPY OUTSIDE AF FAMILY OR WAS PROFOUNDLY TRANSFORMATIVE IS THERE
309_dileep_george|SO EACH CORTICAL COLUMN CAN BE TORT OFF AS REPRESENTING
309_françois_chollet|ARE QUITE DIFFERENT FROM ANYTHING THAT ANY AFAR EVOLUTIONAY ANCISTERS AS IF ARE ENCONTER
309_grant_sanderson|RIGHT AND IT'S  WHAT WOULD THAT BE
309_jitendra_malik|HAT GARESSE IS THERE
309_joscha_bach|INTO THE ATROPIC ABESS AND YOU HAVE TO PAY THE BILL OGE A RUSHAS MY FIRST LANGUAGE
309_matt_botvinick|THE HUMAN BRAIN DO IN THE SENSE THAT
309_richard_karp|SURPASSES A SIX MONTHS OLD CHILD IN TERMS OF COMPREHENSION OF THE WORLD
309_sara_seager|KIND OF VAGUELY REMEMBER THAT W AT THE TIME IT WAS A BIG DEAL BUT IT WAS ALL SO INCREDIBLY CONTROVERSIAL
309_sheldon_solomon|ANE IS IS THAT JUST LIKE LOT PEOPLE ARE NOT GOING TO BEHAVE WITH INTEGRITY
310_dileep_george|THAT ONE CONCEPT ONE VALIBLE
310_françois_chollet|U RACIPOROF GENERLIZING FAMUSH
310_grant_sanderson|UM HOW MANY TIMES YOU HAVE TER DOUBLE TO GET OVER A HUNDRED LIKE SEVEN SIX AND A HALF TIME SOMETHING LIKE THAT MAY SO
310_ian_hutchinson|ONE IS DO WE HAVE ENOUGH EURANIUM OR OTHER FICILE FUELS TO SUPPLY OUR ENGY NEEDS
310_manolis_kellis|UNDERSTANDING THE HUMAN BRAIN
310_peter_singer|CLISE AM
310_russ_tedrake|RACES AND SO FOR ME THIS IS A INO A WAY TO PROTECT MYSELF
310_sara_seager|INEXIION PLANETS
310_sergey_levine|AND THAT'S REALLY A BIG PART OF WHY AR ELLAS A LITTLE BA TUGH
310_sheldon_solomon|AND
310_steven_pressfield|HOW A I MEANYOU YOU'VE SPOKEN WITH PEOPLE WHO SEEM MILTER COMBAT OH YET ISRAEL
311_ben_goertzel|INDIFFERENT WAYS WHIL WE ALL HAVE BISQLY THE SAME
311_françois_chollet|OUT OF DISTRIBUTION IF YOU CONSIDER OUR U EVOLUTION HISTORY AS BEING  IN A WAY OF STRAING DE
311_grant_sanderson|AT THAT POINT YOU'RE LOOKING AT FORTY THREE FORTY FOUR DAYS INTO IT YOU'RE NOT EVEN AT ONE PERSON OF THE LAKE
311_ian_hutchinson|FOR A LONG TIME THE ONSWER TO THAT IS WE KNOW WE HAVE
311_kate_darling|SO THE THE DEVICE ITSELF IT'S FELT THAT YOU COULD LOSE A LOT BECAUSE
311_richard_karp|COMPLEXITY OF HUMAN INTELLIGENCE ALL THE COGNITABILITIES WE HAVE ALL THE EMOTION
311_robert_langer|HOW HARD IS IT TOO
312_ben_goertzel|R CULTURES FOCUSED ON UN
312_brian_kernighan|TEY WER
312_david_eagleman|HOW OUR UNIVERSE WORKS HOW TOTALLY OFF BASE WE MIGHT BE WITH THE SCIENCE UNTIL I MAY WE ANAN
312_dileep_george|OR BRISKLY AND CORDING THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THESE RANAN VIRILES
312_jitendra_malik|SO MUCH OF THE WORK AND COMPUTERVISION SO MANY OF THE BREAK THROUGHS THAT YOU'VE BEEN A PART OF HAVE BEEN IN THE STATIC WORLD
312_joscha_bach|TO GET EVERYBODY PLUMBING
312_kate_darling|IF YOU CREATE A CONNECTION
312_peter_singer|THE ARGUMENT FOR SAYING THAT IN THY CIRCUMSTANCE WE SHOULD GIVE THEM RIHTS IS THAT IF WE DON'T WILL
312_richard_karp|DO YOU THINK THAT COULD BE REDUCED ONE DAY OR JUST
312_russ_tedrake|MANY YEARS AGO
312_steven_pressfield|THE THE EXPERIENCE OF KILLING
313_françois_chollet|THE SKILLS WE'VE LEARNED PREVIOUSLY
313_ian_hutchinson|URANIUM TO SUPPORT FISH AND ENERGY WORLD WIDE
313_jitendra_malik|AT DYNAMIC SES AND THEN THERE IS RABOTIC VISION WHICH IS DYNAMIC
313_kate_darling|AND THEN IT IS IT ECREATES MORE OPPORTUNITY FOR FRUSTRATION FOR
313_richard_karp|FUNDAMENTAL T CAN BE REDUCED TO AN OUTA SET OF ALGRYLMS OR AN ALGRYTHM
313_sara_seager|OUR BIG MASSIVE PLANET
313_sheldon_solomon|ND PUBLIC HEALTH AND INFRE STRUCTURE
313_steven_pressfield|IT'S THI SORT OF JUST WHAT I SAID I'MANI'M EVEN THINKING OF ONE PILOT
314_brian_kernighan|THOSE KINDS OF THINGS HAPPENED
314_dileep_george|ER THE CONECTIONS BETWEEN THE CORTICAL COLUMNS IMPLOMENT THIS
314_kate_darling|OR NEGATIVE STUFF
314_peter_singer|AGAINST OTHER BEINGS WHO ARE NOT RHOBOTS AND WHO REALLY DO SUFFER
314_richard_karp|CAN TORING MACHINE HU HU ACHIEVE HUMAN LEVEL INTELLIGENCE
314_russ_tedrake|JUST T UNDERSTAND BECAUSE I FELT LIKE I COULDN'T
315_ben_goertzel|MANIFEST TES IN A
315_brian_kernighan|UITE OFTEN IN THAT
315_dileep_george|AH YOU KNOW THAT'S WHERE THE KNOWLEDGE IS STOOD
315_françois_chollet|MINDO'S DEFINITELY LIBI A LITLE BIT OF THAT BUT IT'S PRETTY CLEAR TO ME THAT TWE WOULD TO
315_grant_sanderson|OAR JUST THE MIRACLE OF THE EXPENENTIAL FUNCTION IN GENERAL'S ILLA MUSQUE SO
315_kate_darling|THEN IT DOES FOR POSITORSELF
315_manolis_kellis|BY THE BRAIN IT MAY HAVE TAKEN FIFTY YEARS
315_sergey_levine|YES SO THE TERMIS ON POLICY AND OFF POLICY REFER TO HOW YOU GET YOUR DATA
315_sheldon_solomon|I'M JUST EAGER TO
316_ben_goertzel|BIOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS BUT STILL
316_brian_kernighan|BETTER WAIYT TO END O BRYAN THINK IT SO MUCH FOR TALKING TA AS AN HONOR DOKE LIKE MY PLEASURE
316_david_eagleman|AND YOU KNOW WE HAVE OF COURSE THE
316_françois_chollet|EVERYTHING WE DO WE DO I TO HIS COGNITY BILLING BROX THAT WE ACQUIRE
316_grant_sanderson|
316_ian_hutchinson|O THAT'S RESOURCES
316_joscha_bach|IS IN SOME SENSE TO STATE THAT ALL ANIMALS ON EARTH ARE IN
316_peter_singer|INTERESTINGLY AMONG
316_steven_pressfield|YOU KNOW WAS STRIFING THE TANK
317_ben_goertzel|YEELL THERE'S PROBABLY LIMITS
317_brian_kernighan|GOOD FUN
317_david_eagleman|AH AS THE JEW H'S BEEN DIFFICULT TO READ BUT A THE HORISIN FALL THE THIRD RIKE
317_david_patterson|THE ANSWER IN BOTH THOSE CASES IS NO
317_jitendra_malik|SAID IF YOU LOOK AT AT DEEPER
317_matt_botvinick|A PUT THEIR FINGER ON A CINDROME THAT WAS ASSOCIATED WITH FRONNALD DAMAGE ACTUALLY ONE OF THEM WAS A A RUSSIAN A NORA PSYCHOLOGIST NAME LURIA
317_richard_karp|HUMAN BRAIN
317_russ_tedrake|RY TO LEARN TO DO CORRECT
317_sergey_levine|WECALL THAT ONPOLICY DATA
317_sheldon_solomon|LET'S START WITH OUR MOST CONTEMPORARY UNDERSTANDING
317_steven_pressfield|YOU KNOW ONE REMOVE OR MORE REMOVES FROM AN INFANTRYMAN WHEN AN INFANCRYMAN DOES AND HE SAID THAT THE
318_françois_chollet|I AM NOCOGNITION TO CERTAIN CONTECT WHICH IS DO YOU MEAN CONDITION VAMAGE AH BUT STILL
318_jitendra_malik|QUESTION THERE
318_kate_darling|MAKROSOVS CLYPPY
318_manolis_kellis|AN BUT BUT THE O
318_peter_singer|THAT WE HAVE ANY DIRECT DUTIES TO ANIMALS THIS INCLUDES PEOPLE LIKE THOMAS AQUINAS AND EMMANUE CAN
318_robert_langer|DO IT OTHERWISE I MEAN ANAD THAT BY THE WAY MAY NOT BE THE
318_sheldon_solomon|O OF HUMAN NATURE
319_françois_chollet|ITS CIVOLUTION ARHISTORY
319_ian_hutchinson|SO THAT'S A CHALLENGE OF FISHING AM THERE'S A PROBLEM OF SAFETY
319_manolis_kellis|UNDERLYING ARCHITECTURE
319_matt_botvinick|AND AND WHAT HE STARTED TO
320_brian_kernighan|A SLEEP MATTRESS AND
320_david_patterson|SYMIC ONDUCTOR IMPROVING AND MOR'S LAW
320_ian_hutchinson|AR BEYOND THAT AND THAT IS
320_joscha_bach|IMAGINE THERE WOULD BE SOME VERY CLEVER MICROPE THAT WOULD LIVE IN OUR ORGANISMS AND WOULD A COMPLETELY
320_manolis_kellis|IS VERY MUCH INSPIRED
320_matt_botvinick|FIGRE OUT WAS THAT
320_robert_langer|IN ADDITION TO FUNDING IMPORTANT AREAS LIKE WHAT BOTH OF THOSE PEOPLE DID
320_sheldon_solomon|TEND TO CO OPERATE
320_steven_pressfield|THOUSANDS ER A THOUSAND HUNDRED THAT CHANGES ENTIRE SOCIETYEH THAT'S WHAT WE'VE SEEN
321_brian_kernighan|RACON ERBUDS
321_david_eagleman|WHAT DO WE THINK ABOUT THAT AND A LIVEWIRED BRAIN
321_david_patterson|WE ARE NOT DOUBLIN TRANSITES EVERY YES YEARS
321_françois_chollet|DEGREE TO WHICH
321_grant_sanderson|ABOUT THAT KIND OF WAY TO SEE THE WORLD
321_joscha_bach|HARVEST THEM AND CHANGE THEM INTO A THING THAT IS
321_kate_darling|THE GREATEST
321_manolis_kellis|BY THE HUMAN BRAIN WHICH ACTUALLY POSITS A VERY VERY INTERESTING QUESTION
321_matt_botvinick|THE FRONT OL CORTEX WAS SOMEHOW INVOLVED IN FLEXIBILITY THE IN IN
322_ben_goertzel|HEADING TORD IN N IN PRACTICE JUST AS A THEORETICAL POINT
322_brian_kernighan|LEASE CONSIDER SUPPORTING THIS POT GAS
322_david_eagleman|LIKE HOW HOW DO WE THINK ABOUT THESE EXTREME
322_david_patterson|THE DOWNSIDE FOR A COMPANY LIKE INTEL IS PEOPLE THINK
322_dileep_george|AH NOUO THING TO SUFFER ACTUALLY DONE IX EXPERIMENTS
322_jitendra_malik|SOMETIMES RE REGAIN
322_kate_darling|ASSISTANCE WE VE EVER BUILT
322_peter_singer|WE MAY DEVELOP A CRUEL DISPOSITION AND THIS WILL BE BAD
322_steven_pressfield|HOW IMPORTANT IS
323_ben_goertzel|I WAS VERY DUBIOUS THAT THE
323_brian_kernighan|BY GOING TO EIHT SLEEP DOCT COMSLASH LEC
323_david_patterson|THAT MEANS IT STOPPED THAT TECHNOLOGY HAS NO LONGER IMPROVED AND SO JIM IS TRYING TO
323_dileep_george|O THE TUNE OF SHOWING THESE THINGS
323_françois_chollet|AND LIKE TO KEEP POINT YOUR MAKING WHICH I THINK IS QUITE BEAUTIFUL AS LIKE WE SHOULDN'T
323_manolis_kellis|AND THEY PERFORM AMAZINGLY WELL IS IT BECAUSE THEY CAN SIMULATE ANY POSSIBLE FUNCTION
323_richard_karp|WHY THAT MAY BE TRUE IN PRINCIPLE THAT CANNOT BE THE WAWER EVENTUALLY GOTTI TACKLLOSS PROBLEM INS
323_robert_langer|AH CERTAIN FOUNDATIONS THAT HAT THAT FUN THINGS AND OTHER FOUNDATIONS THAT
323_russ_tedrake|AZA IXIGIST
323_sara_seager|ALREADY SO TAS ALREADY AND YETLE
323_steven_pressfield|MORTALITY
324_david_eagleman|YOU KNOW FIRST OF ALL
324_jitendra_malik|AH THAT
324_joscha_bach|IF I IF IT DEPENDS ON FITBACKLOPS AND SO FOR INSTANCE I IT'S LIKELY TO
324_matt_botvinick|OR TO DO SOMETHING UNUSUAL
324_robert_langer|YOU DON'T WANT TO SEE DISEASE TREATED WELL THEN
324_russ_tedrake|TOOK SONGS THAT ARE HUNTED EIGHTY BEASTS PER MINUTE
324_sheldon_solomon|CAN WE THINK ABOUT TO KIND O HIT THAT SWEET SPOT AND THAT THAT WOULD BE
324_steven_pressfield|FINITENESS THE THE FACT THAT THIS THING ENDS TO THE CREATIVE PROCESS
325_ben_goertzel|YOU NOUGT I'M A CYNICAL TEAGER I THINK HUMAN SIR
325_brian_kernighan|THESE BOTH ARE AMAZING PRODUCTS
325_david_eagleman|I SAW A COVER OF TIME MAGAZINE SOME YEARS AGO
325_david_patterson|DISAGREED THAT IT SLOWING DOWN
325_françois_chollet|WE SHOULD MEASURE THE SKILL
325_grant_sanderson|WHAT'S MORE INTERESTING I THINK IS TO IMREALLY UNDERSTAND WHY
325_jitendra_malik|IF WE ESSENTIALLY LOSE PART OF THE JUICE THAT COULD ENABLE US TO SOLVE THE PROB
325_joscha_bach|THAT WE SHOULD ESCRIBE A CERTAIN DEGREE OF INTELLIGENCE TO PLANS
325_kate_darling|AN I MEAN IT WAS OBVIOUSLY TECHKNOWLEDGY WAS WAY
326_ben_goertzel|HUMANS ARE JUST JERKS THE STATE IS NOT IN A WITHER AWAY IF YOU DON'T HAVE
326_david_eagleman|ER AN IT WAS A BIG GENOTE SAGURAL SLICE OF THE BRAIN AND IT SAID SOMETHING LIKE
326_david_patterson|CRISP YOU KNOW A MORIMS CARVER MEAD
326_grant_sanderson|EXPINITIAL GROWTH HAPPENS
326_ian_hutchinson|A MANY TENS OF METERS HIGH THAT CAME THROUGH AND DESTROYED THE ELECTRICITY
326_joscha_bach|THE PROMISE THAT PLANS DON'T HAVE A NERVOUS SYSTEM
326_kate_darling|NOT THERE AT THE TIME
326_manolis_kellis|AND THAT FOR GETS INTERESTING BE ANSWERS
326_matt_botvinick|IN AEREFLEXIBLE WAY FROM ONE MOMENT TO ANOTHER
326_richard_karp|IF YOU BELIEVE THAT THE BRAIN IS
326_sara_seager|THERE'S ALL THESE PLANETS ROAMING ABOUT IN THIS LIKE
326_sergey_levine|AND YOU NOW THIS IS SOMETHING THAT
326_sheldon_solomon|ENGAGING AR MORE CO OPERATIVE AND RECIPOCAL
327_ben_goertzel|SOME STRUCTURE KEEPING PEOPLE FROM SCREWING EACH OTHER OVER THEY'RE GOING TO DO IT NOT SO NOW I A SHE DON'T QUITE SEE THINGS THAT WAY I MEAN I THINK
327_david_eagleman|BECAUSE WERE LIVE WIRED
327_dileep_george|AH IT WILL INHIBIT THOUGH THIS COMPLICATED LUTULE TALAMUS IT WILL INHIBIT THIS OTHER COLU
327_ian_hutchinson|GREAT FEED
327_joscha_bach|SO THEY DON'T HAVE A VADED TO TELEGRAPH MESSAGES OVER LARGE DISTANCES ALMOST INSTANTLY IN THE PLAN
327_kate_darling|OF BEING ABLE TO BE A RECOMMENDER SYSTEM FOR ASSISTING YOU IN ANYTHING IN TYPING
327_matt_botvinick|SAID FOCUSTON LIKE NEW EXPERIENCES AN SO ARM SO THE WAY YOUR BRAIN
327_richard_karp|IS
327_sara_seager|DIMLY LIT DARKNESS
327_sheldon_solomon|S HANDAND SEES
328_ben_goertzel|MY FEELING NOW SUBJECTIVELY AS THE CULTURE ASPECT
328_brian_kernighan|IF YOU ENJOY THIS THING SUBSCRIBED Y NEUTUBE REVIEW IT WITH FIRE STARS AND APOPAD CASTS
328_david_patterson|AH AND THEY'RE NOT CLAIMING THERE'S A NEW MORSE LAW THEY'RE NOT SAYING
328_ian_hutchinson|TO THE FUKISHIMA REACTORS AND THEIR COOLING
328_joscha_bach|WE MIGHT NOT BE THE MOST INTELLIGENT
328_manolis_kellis|IT EVOLVED IN A WORLD
328_peter_singer|I WOULD LIKE TO SAY THAT
328_robert_langer|THAT SAID YOUARE SOME OF YOUR INITIAL STRUGGLES
328_sara_seager|IT POTENTIALLY A LIFE I MEAN IT JUST MY BLOWING BUT A BEU GIVE A BRIEF
328_sergey_levine|THAT IT JUST TAKES SOME VERY SMART PEOPLE TO GET TOGETHER AND THINK ABOUT IT REALLY HARD WHEREAS IF IT WAS LIKE A
329_ben_goertzel|IS MORE SIGNIFICANT THAN I THOUGHT IT WAS WHEN I WHEN I WAS A TEANAJOR AN I THINK
329_françois_chollet|IS TEMPTING TO MEASURE THE SKILLS YES
329_ian_hutchinson|WAS THEN TURNED OFF
329_jitendra_malik|BY DAH
329_manolis_kellis|WITH PHYSICAL CONSTRAINTS
329_matt_botvinick|RING THIS FUNCTION INTO
329_peter_singer|IF THAT RUMBE IS DEDICATED
329_sara_seager|LIKE HISTORY OF
329_sheldon_solomon|A SORT OF INDISAGREEMENT WITH TEVEN PINKER THAT THE WORLD IS A
329_steven_pressfield|YOU KNOW THE FACT OF MORTALITY IS
330_david_eagleman|I THINKIT WAS TOSSRO YOU SAID THAT THE KING BECOMES
330_david_patterson|THE IDEA OF MOURE'S LAW IS TIED UP WITH MARKETING IT WOULD BE NICE IIF IT'S WETHER IT'S MARKETING OR IT'S IT'S A
330_françois_chollet|I'M IN DE SKIVISE A ONLITING YOU CAN OBJECTIVELY
330_joscha_bach|GETS DRESSED THE NEXT GENERATION OF MICE WILL BE MORE SPARS AND MORE SQUANNY
330_kate_darling|IS THE PEOPLE WHO
330_richard_karp|UNLESS WE GRAT ENOUGH INSIDHE INTO THE OPERATION OF THE BRAIN
330_robert_langer|THAT EADEDN QUITE FOR PEOPLE FIT INTO A PARTICULAR BUCKET  A PARTICULAR RIG
330_sheldon_solomon|AND IN THAT REGARD I MEAN THERE MORE UNKNOWN VOICES THAT HAVE TAKEN ISSUE
330_steven_pressfield|KIND OF GIVES MEANING TO LIFE YOU KNOW I THINK THAT'S WHY WE WANT TO CREATE UN
331_david_eagleman|SLAVE TO THE TO THE PEOPLE
331_grant_sanderson|THAT THE SOFT WHERE YEU WRITE ENABLES YOU TO WRITE MORE SOFTWARE
331_joscha_bach|WELL A VERY NARROW DEFINITION OF
331_peter_singer|IMPOSSIBLE FOR US
331_sergey_levine|AND THEN YOU GET TO
331_steven_pressfield|THAT'S WHY WE WANT TO MAKE A MARK OF SOME KIND OR A
332_ben_goertzel|THAN OUR CURRENT SOCIETY AND OF COURSE GREATER MATERIAL ABUNDANCE HELPS BUT TO SOME EXTENT MATERIAL ABUNDANCE
332_david_patterson|NI JUST AN TELL BUT EVERYBODY YIT'S IN SPART MOORE'S LAW'S INSPIRING YE WHY YO LIT OUT EVERYBODY BUT
332_dileep_george|SOMETHING SOME BUT I GUESS WHAT I'M ASKING IS
332_françois_chollet|WHEN OU SEE SKILL
332_joscha_bach|BUT MAYBE THE TREES ARE THE ONES THAT MADE THE PHONES
332_peter_singer|I WOULD I WOULD LIKE TO APPLY THE SAME ARGUMENT AS WITH ANIMALS TO ROBOTS THAT THEY DESERVE RIGHTS IN THAT SENSE NOW WE MIGHT
332_sara_seager|SO IN EXO PLANETS
332_sergey_levine|CENDRO BOUGHT OUT TO DO A LITTLE EXPLIRATION I WHAT WAS THAT ROLE OF MIXING THEM TOGETHER
332_sheldon_solomon|LIKE WHAT REALLY WEARS ME IS THE
333_dileep_george|IS THAT SOMETHING A THAT WUSPOS I THINK OF SOMETHING THAT'S HUMAN INTERPRETABLE OF THAT SOMETHING IT DOESN'T NEED TO BE
333_grant_sanderson|LIKE THE ADVENT OF THE INNERNET MAKES IT FASTER TO LEARN THINGS WHICH MAKES IT FASTER TO AH CREATE NEW THINGS CR
333_ian_hutchinson|AR FUEL RESOURCES IT HAS
333_joscha_bach|I AM IKE I BUT YOU SAY THE ENTIRETY OF LIFE DID IT YOU KNOW A THE FIRST CELL NEVER DIED
333_richard_karp|NETWORK OF A
333_sheldon_solomon|TH THE RISE AND FALLO THE THIRD RIKE AND I MEAN
333_steven_pressfield|WHY ARE WE IN THE FLESH IN Y SORT OF I LIKE TO BELIEVE THAT GOD OR SOME FORCE IS
334_ben_goertzel|ANY FACTORIES R SO I
334_david_eagleman|SAY THAT IT'S YOU KNOW IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO SAY
334_dileep_george|IT DOESN'T NEED TO BE HUMAN INTERPRETABLE THERE'S NO NEED FOR IT TO BE HUMAN INTERPRETABLE AH BUT IT'S IT'S ALMOST LIKE
334_ian_hutchinson|FAR MORE BENIGN
334_manolis_kellis|YOU KNOW THE HEARING IS JUST DIFFERENT MOVEMENTS IN AIR
334_matt_botvinick|THE HUMAN BRAIN
334_robert_langer|HIS IS THERE
334_russ_tedrake|WHAT'S LIKE FEELINGWISE WHATS IT SHE LIKE
334_sergey_levine|SPACE OF REINFORCEMENT LEARNING NOW OR THER WHAT'S A AN MAYBE TAKIN AS TE BACK
334_sheldon_solomon|THE MOUNT
334_steven_pressfield|WERE ON SOME KIND OF JOURNEY UM BUT I'M NOT SURE WHY
335_grant_sanderson|OFTENTIMES WHILIKE INVESTMENT WILL GROW EXPININTIALLY THAT THE MORE RESOURCES A COMPANY HAS IF IT KNOWS HOW TO USE THEM WELL THE MORE AH
335_sara_seager|IS CONSTANTLY SHIFTING
335_sergey_levine|NOT JUST NOW BUT WHAT'S TO USE THE MOST BEAUTIFUL IDEA
335_sheldon_solomon|OF ANGER
335_steven_pressfield|IN THIS WORLD WHERE THE GROUND RULES ARE IF YOU THINK ABOUT ANIMAL LIFE
336_david_eagleman|WHAT WE OFTEN THINK OF IS BEING EVIL IN SOCIETY IS A MY LAT RECENTLY PUBLISH
336_dileep_george|IN THE GRAPHI
336_françois_chollet|YOU NO THEY DID THAT
336_grant_sanderson|THE MORE CAN ACTUALY GROW SO I MEAN YOU KNOW YOU REFERENCEAL ON MUSK I THINK
336_joscha_bach|PON NEW CLEAR WEAPONS AND WEAPONS OF WARRAN GENERAL WHAT DO YOU THINK IF YOUH'D TO
336_peter_singer|THAT THE DISPLAY OF SUFFERING CREATES
336_sheldon_solomon|AND HATRED AND
336_steven_pressfield|THAT YOU CANNOT LIVE FROM ONE DAY TO THE NEXT WITHOUT KILLING AND EATING
337_ben_goertzel|MODIVE OF SOCIAL EXISTENCE THEN
337_david_eagleman|SOME WORK ON
337_françois_chollet|BECAUSE THEY ARE GENERALLY INTELLIGENT AND SO THEY THEY MAY AS WELL HAVE ACQUIRED
337_joscha_bach|YOU ARE A BETTING MAN WHAT WOULD YOU BETTER ON IN TERMS OF SELF DESTRUCTION
337_robert_langer|BUT OUTSIDE THE DISCIPLINES OF
337_russ_tedrake|SANZERS WHO ROQUE
337_sergey_levine|IN GENERAL
337_sheldon_solomon|THAT'S WHAT WORRIES ME IS WHARE THIS
338_david_patterson|AN INEUR
338_dileep_george|AH BY THE WAY WHATS ARE THESE THE CORTICOM MICRO CIRCUITS SELICT THESE ARE THE CODICAL MICROCEDCATES T
338_françois_chollet|A IS NNOT INTERRAGENT
338_ian_hutchinson|BUT CLEARLY THERE HAVE BEEN
338_kate_darling|ESSENTIALLY SOMETHING THAT PEOPLE WOULD AN THEIR MEMORPHIES HAVE A DEEP CONNECTION WITH
338_manolis_kellis|HAPPENED TO WORK WELL WITH IMAGES OF THE TYPE THAT WE ENCOUNTER IN THE PHYSICAL ROVITREINHABIT
338_matt_botvinick|THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN
338_peter_singer|THEREFORE WE CAN SAY SOMETHING ABOUT
338_richard_karp|I KNOW THAT THERE ARE A MANY WHO
338_robert_langer|THE PREVIOUS DECADE
338_russ_tedrake|AND A WE DO AMAZING THINGS WITH OUR HANDS AND WE STICK OUR FOOT IN A BIG SOLID SHOE
338_sara_seager|A PLACE WHERE YOU SHOULD BE INVESTING HERE AND RIGHT NOW
339_david_eagleman|PART OF THIS PUZZLE SO IT TURNS OUT THAT WE ARE VERY WE ARE VERY
339_david_patterson|IN NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT YOU COAUTHORD TO PAPER A CASE FOR REDUNDANT DERAYS OF INEXPENSIVE DISCS HENCE HE
339_grant_sanderson|YOU YOU SEE A CURVE AND YOU'RE BLINDLY DRAWING A LINE THROUGH IT
339_ian_hutchinson|CATASTROPHES ASSOCIATED WITH FISH AND REACTORS FUKISHIMAR ACTUALLY IS
339_jitendra_malik|A TO DAY ERE WE ARE NO LONGER DETECTING EDGES
339_kate_darling|WHY ITIS A HARD TO MAKE IT WORK
339_peter_singer|THOUGH HOW REAL IT IS BUT
339_richard_karp|GENERAL INTELLIGENCE CAN BE
339_sheldon_solomon|AND IN THE FORM OF SELF ESTEEM
340_ben_goertzel|E ASPECTS OF A
340_david_eagleman|NOW WHAT WE DO IS WE LABEL EACH HAND WITH A WITH ONEWORD LABEL
340_david_patterson|R A I D RADE SO THAT'S WHERE YOU INTRODUCE THE ADEA RADE
340_dileep_george|THE SUCKET IN IN
340_françois_chollet|OF THE ON THE MEASURE OF INTELLIGENCE PAPER
340_ian_hutchinson|I THINK IN MANY WAYS ARE OFTEN OVERSTATED AS A DISASTER BECAUSE AFTER ALL
340_joscha_bach|YOU SAY SO MANY BRILLIANT POETIC THINGS LIKE WHAT IS A CLOTE IS THAT DO PEOPLE USE THAT TERM CLOSE
340_matt_botvinick|THERE ARE
340_richard_karp|ACHIEVED AND THERE ARE EVEN SOME WHO ARE FEEL CERTAIN
340_robert_langer|EVERY SO OFTEN
340_russ_tedrake|AND THAT'S WHY YOU'RE MORE AWARE OF SOME OF THE GATES
341_david_patterson|INCREDIBLE THA THAT LITTLE
341_françois_chollet|IF YOU WANT TO BE ABLE TO
341_kate_darling|THINK IT'S A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT THINGS
341_richard_karp|AM DOUBTFUL OF THIS WILL
341_russ_tedrake|FLAWS AND STUFF LIKE THIS
341_sheldon_solomon|A LOT OF JOBS
342_ben_goertzel|AND IF WE LOOK AT WHERE WE ARE IN SOCIETY NOW
342_david_eagleman|AND IT TURNS OUT FOR EVERYBODY CROSS ALL RELIGIONS THEY CARE MUCH MORE ABOUT THEIR IN GROUP THAN THEIR ACCROTE AND WHEN I SAY THEY CARE WHAT I MEAN IS
342_dileep_george|SE KAN THINK OF IN A LET'S THINGO IN NUDEL
342_matt_botvinick|A PERFORMED BEHAVIORS SO THAT THEY CAN BE
342_peter_singer|HAS BEEN HELD ABOUT UWMANS WHICH IS RATHER LIKE WHAT YOU TOK ABOUT AND THATS BEHAVIORIS
342_richard_karp|EVER BE ACHIEFS
342_robert_langer|I MAN'T IT AT MY TEA I THINK
342_sara_seager|EVERY ONE ELSE IS
342_sergey_levine|THISUS AM
342_sheldon_solomon|ARE GONE AND THERE NOT COMING BACK AND THAT'S THE WERE THE SELPHESTINE ATS WHERE THER SOLPHESTIM AND IDENTITY COME IN
343_david_eagleman|YOU GET A BIGGER RESPONSE FROM THEIR BRAIN EVERYTHING IS THE SAME AS THE SAME HANDS
343_dileep_george|NETWORK IN ARTIFICIAL NEURANETWORK TERMS YOU KNOW PEOPLE TALK ABOUT THE ARCHITECTURE OF THO INNO SUD HOW MANY
343_grant_sanderson|LIKE IN AN EPIDEMIC AS YOU APPROACH TH ATURATION THAT WOULD BREAK DOWN IM AS YOU DO ANYTHING THAT A
343_ian_hutchinson|THAT KILLED BETWEEN FIFTEEN AND TWENTY THOUSAND PEOPLE INSTANTANE MORE OR LESS INSTANTANEOUSLY
343_jitendra_malik|SA EMPHASIZE STARTIC IMAGES I THINK THAT THIS IS CHANGING AND OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS I SEE
343_peter_singer|AM SO BAHAGORISM WAS EMPLOYED BYTH IN PSYCHOLOGY PEOLIKE B F SKINNA AS A FAMOUS BAHAVORIS BUT AM
343_richard_karp|JUST FOR THE FUN OF IT
343_steven_pressfield|A THAT
344_ben_goertzel|PUSHING PEOPLE AND
344_david_patterson|FOR THE MAC AND RANDY ASKED THE QUESTION WHEN HE SAW THIS
344_joscha_bach|YOU AYOU NOT HAVE A NOT A FAITH BUT WOULD HE MAKE OF THE
344_manolis_kellis|ULTIMATELY THE UNDOCTORED IMAGES AT LEAST
344_matt_botvinick|I GUESS ITS HAPPENING THERE WHICH IS WHY
344_russ_tedrake|I MET YES SO I THINK PEOPLE ARE WHO ARE AFRAID OF BAREFOOT RUNNING THEI'R WORY ABOUT GETTING CUTS OR GETTING STEPPING ON ROCKS AM
344_sara_seager|LIKE OUR PHONEOU'VE A FANTASTIC DETECTOR IN THERE LIKE THEY DIDN'T ALWAYS HAVE THAT I DON'T KNOW IF YOU REMEMBER
344_sergey_levine|YOUKNO OPTIMIZING SOME QUANTITY WHEN YOU DON'T ACTUALLY KNOW THE EQUATIONS THAT GOVERN THAT SYSTEM AND THAT
344_sheldon_solomon|NOW WHO ARE YOU
345_david_eagleman|ACTUAY THEIR TWO OTHER THINGS WE DID AS PART OF THIS STUDY THAT I THINK MATTER FOR THIS POINT
345_david_patterson|AH DISK
345_ian_hutchinson|A IN MY IN MY IN MY ESTIMATION THAT A FISH AND ENERGY CAME OUT OF THAT LOOKING PRETTY GOOD
345_joscha_bach|CAPACITY OF TECHNOWLEGE TO TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION TO HELP US PREVENT SOME OF THE WORST
345_kate_darling|I THINK PEOPLE JUST WANTED MORE THEY WANTED MORE FUNCTIONALITY I THINK YOU'RE ALSO RIGHT THAT YOU KNOW THE BUSINESS CASE ISN'T REALLY THERE BECAUSE
345_peter_singer|WHAT IS IT THAT MAKES THIS SCIENCE WHERE YOU NEED TO HAVE BEHAVIOUR BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT YOU CAN OBSERVE YOU CAN OBSERVE CONSCIOUSNESS AM
345_sara_seager|SO CALLED OLDEN DAYS WE DIDN'T HAVE DIGEL CAMERAS WE HAD FILM
345_sergey_levine|AND TO ME THATS ACTUALY SEEMS
346_david_patterson|THE READY WAS INVOLVED IN THE AND THE FOURTH
346_françois_chollet|AND IDEALY DISMEASURE OF INTELLIGENCE SHOULD BE
346_ian_hutchinson|A USERS OF DATA WE SEEM TO BE VERY SCARED OF A
346_jitendra_malik|I AVE THE GENERICE STATEMENT THAT
346_joscha_bach|DAMAGES THAT THIS
346_manolis_kellis|TO UNDERSTAND THE PHYSICAL WORLD AROUND US THE MORE WE WILL BE ABLE TO BRING NEW COMPUTATIONAL PRIMITIVE
346_richard_karp|BY THE SUPERINTELLIGENT NEW SPECIES WHAT'S YOUR ANTUITION WHY THAT'S NOT QUITE N
346_sara_seager|OU TAKE A FILM CAMERA YOU SEND THE FILM AWAY AND EVENTUALLY COMES BACK AND THEN YOU SEE YOUR PICTURES AND THAKE IT ALL BE HORRIBLE
347_david_eagleman|AND NOW IT HAPPENS OVER THE COURSE OF ANY TROUS YOU SEE EVERYBODY GETS STABBED AT DIFFERENT TIMES
347_david_patterson|OF TAKING A LOT OF THESE DISK DEVELOPED FOR PERSONAL COMPETERS AND MACANTASHES AND PUTTING
347_ian_hutchinson|CAN WE TALK ABOUT YOUR CLER WEAPONS JUST
347_joscha_bach|CONDITION CRAY THOUGH AS AN EXAMPLE
347_kate_darling|GREAT NUMBERS I THINK WHAT WE DID SEE FROM THE PEOPLE WHO DID YUM GET GEBO IS A LOT OF THEM BECAME VERY
347_robert_langer|AND MENTIONED TWO PLACES BENIN BILL'S CHOCOLATE AORIUM
347_russ_tedrake|HINT LIKE IS THERE ARE TIPS OR TRICKS THAT YOU HAVE
347_sergey_levine|OR THEN NOT THEN TAKEN A STEP INTO THE MORE
348_ben_goertzel|FOR NEW TYPES OF GOVERNMENTS NEW TYPES OF LEADERSHIP NEW TYPES OF SYSTEMS WHAT AH
348_david_eagleman|THAT WHAT I WANTED TO DO WAS TO LOOK AT
348_dileep_george|A ANDER AN S WITHIN A LEVEL WHATEVER IS THAT CIRCUITARY WITHIN A COLUMN OF THE COTTECKS AND BETWEEN THE LAYERS OF THE COTTECKS
348_grant_sanderson|LIKE AN OPERATIONAL CHALLENGE IF LIKE HOW YOU RON A COMPANY AW YOU R N A GROUP OF PEOPLE
348_jitendra_malik|YOU CAN QUANTIFY THAT BECAUSE YOU CAN TAKE SOME OF THE CHALLENGING WIT DIEU DE TASETS AND
348_manolis_kellis|WITH A VERY TINY LITTLE SUPSIT OF FUNCTIONS
348_matt_botvinick|BUT AM
348_peter_singer|HE SAID WELL  E MEANING OF A TERM IS ITS USE AND WE USE TERMS LIKE
348_sara_seager|THE TRANSITING PLANETS
348_sergey_levine|THIS KIND OF APPROACH CAN OPERATE AND CAN YOU MADE ME SAY WHAT IS DEEP REINFORCEMENT LEARNING
349_ben_goertzel|AND SO WHAT ARE THE FORCES AT PLAY
349_david_eagleman|HOW IN GRAINED IS THIS OR HOW ARBITRARY IS SO WE BOUGHT NEW
349_david_patterson|THAT I END
349_grant_sanderson|IS THAT ANY ONE INVENTION HAS A RIPPLE THAT'S UNSTOPPED
349_ian_hutchinson|THAT'S WHAT SETS THEM OFF
349_jitendra_malik|WO THOUSAND NINE IN OBJECT EDICTION YOU NOW
349_joscha_bach|I ALSO CONSIDER
349_richard_karp|SPEECH OR
349_robert_langer|OLTMALE WHITE RAIS AND COOKING I SET WON MY HEART JUST FROM THE PICTURES
349_sergey_levine|WILL DEEPER INFORCEMY LEARNING
350_david_eagleman|PART I SPENS IN
350_dileep_george|RLACK BAT THEY SHOULD IT'S A'S A NICE OGGE A OCKITS FOR THAT SIR
350_ian_hutchinson|THAT'S WHAT SETS THEM OFF SO FU LOOK AT THE HYDROGEN BAR MAYBE YO CAN SAY HOW THESE DIFFERENT WEAPONS WORK
350_jitendra_malik|IS LIKE ABOUT TEN YEARS BEHIND AND AH
350_manolis_kellis|HOW MUCH OF THE PHYSICAL WORLD AROUND US WE PERCEIVE AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE
350_matt_botvinick|GENERALLY UNDERSTOOD THESE DAYS
350_richard_karp|RABODIX OR HER
351_ben_goertzel|POSSIBLE FUTURES IN WHICH A MARS COLONY
351_david_patterson|OT I'D SAY
351_dileep_george|THAT THAT'S  TA THE CORTICAL MICROCIGUS WHO WATS INTERESTING ABOUT
351_joscha_bach|OUTCOMES OF GLOBELROMING IMAGINABLE RATE
351_kate_darling|HOSE KEEP SHIFTING DEPENDING ON WHAT SCIENSFICTION THAT IS PROBABULAR BUT ALSO A TOOTHINGS ITS PEEBLE EXPECTATION AND
351_matt_botvinick|SORT OF ININCONTRADISTINCTION
351_peter_singer|I'VE JUST HAD A DREAM OF ENA HERE I WAS
351_robert_langer|THE PERFECT COOKIE
351_sara_seager|OR MINUTES AND WERE MEASURING THE BRIGHTNESS OF A STAR LIKE EVERY FRAME
351_steven_pressfield|WHEN YOU SEE CHILDREN
352_ben_goertzel|MAKES A CRITICAL DIFFERENCE FOR HUMANITY
352_david_patterson|I THINK I'M NATURALLY AN OPTIMIST BUT A
352_grant_sanderson|LIKE AN A PSYCHOLOGICAL LEVEL ON A HUMAN LEVEL CAUSE IT'S NOT EXPENENTIAL IT'S IT'S JUST A CONSISTENT
352_ian_hutchinson|AND THEIR ENERGY IS ESSENTIALLY ENTIRELY DERIVED FROM FISHING REACTIONS
352_richard_karp|FLEXIBLE COMPUTER ASSISTANCE IR ANY OF THAT COMES ANYWHERE NEAR CLOSE
352_russ_tedrake|AM HE'S AN INTERESTING GUY
352_sergey_levine|IT MIGHT AT FIRST SEEM LIKE A PRETTY ARBITRARY THING JUST TAKE THESE TWO COMPONENTS AND STICK THEM TOGETHER BUT THE REASON THAT IT'S A
353_ben_goertzel|OR AR AR AR VERY FEW AMAD A A A THINK
353_jitendra_malik|D'YE THINK
353_joscha_bach|CLOSE COOLING SIRCIRCUIT THAT TA THAT EMPOWERS THE COMMUNITIES LIKE
353_peter_singer|AND SI SO WHAT IT IS TO BE IN PINE IS TO EXHIBIT THESE SYMPTOMS OF PINE BEHAVIOUR
353_richard_karp|TO THAT LEVEL OF COGNITION
353_robert_langer|AND MAY BE A BIT OF DATO DRIVEN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE OR HIS COOKIES
353_steven_pressfield|THAT THEY COME INTO THE WORLD WITH PERSONALITIES
354_ben_goertzel|SUPPLYING THAT THE THE GOODS ARE
354_dileep_george|YE THE A VICIAL QUARTEX
354_jitendra_malik|DO YOU THINK SOME KIND OF INJECTION OF KNOWLEDGE BASIS AND REASONING IS REQUIRED
354_joscha_bach|COMMUNALS OPERATING SYSTEM THAT WE HAVE AND
354_robert_langer|SOMETHING THATS
354_sheldon_solomon|YOU KNOW YOU USE MONEY TO MAKE MONEY AN A
355_ben_goertzel|FROM FROM EARTH ARGAN IN EFFECT BEIN IN CONTROL OF THAT OF THAT MARS COLONY OF COURSE THERE ARE
355_françois_chollet|VERVAS LONG TIME
355_jitendra_malik|TO HELP IMPROVE LIKE ACTION RECOGNITION
355_joscha_bach|THE RT GENERAL TENNESSY
355_manolis_kellis|GRAVIDITIONAL WAVES HAVE BEEN TRAVERSING THE EARTH
355_matt_botvinick|WHAT I USUALLY DO IN THIS SITUATION IS ACTS BUT GIVEN THE CONTEXT
355_russ_tedrake|SO YOU RUN PRETTY GOOD DISTANCES AND YOU BIKE AND
355_sheldon_solomon|A THEREFORE
355_steven_pressfield|I DID IN THE
356_ben_goertzel|OUTLIE SITUATIONS WHERE
356_david_patterson|PSIMI NDUCTOR FORSTORIGE THE FLASH DRIVE INSTEAD OF BEING
356_dileep_george|OW TO BELEVISH AND MODEL
356_françois_chollet|AND T
356_grant_sanderson|HOW FEW PEOPLE
356_matt_botvinick|I PROBABLY SHOULD DO WHY EMEAN
356_peter_singer|OR STUDYING HUMAN BEHAVIOR
356_robert_langer|BUT HE ALSO HAS COMPANIES THAT DU WAM
356_sergey_levine|CLEAN IN SOME WAY LIKE FOR EXAMPLE CLEAN IN THE SENSE THAT
357_ben_goertzel|THOSE ARE VERY VERY VERY
357_david_eagleman|OF MONKEY TROOPS
357_joscha_bach|THEREBY DESTROY OURSELVES W YOU DON'T THINK TACHKNOWLEDGYI CAN WIN THAT RACE
357_kate_darling|OF REALLI
357_richard_karp|TO BE ABLE TO CRACK
357_sara_seager|WELL CARRAGE TELL US AND GO BOTH SO
357_sergey_levine|WHICH WAS GREAT FOR IMAGES BUT IT WAS EVEN MORE A GREAT FOR ALL THE OTHER FIELDS WHERE PEOPLE HADN'T COME UP WITH GOOD FEATURES YET
357_sheldon_solomon|ULTIMATELY GOVERNMENTS BECOME SUBORDINATE
357_steven_pressfield|AND YOU CAN EVEN SEE SORT OF A A DESTINY THERE SO
358_ben_goertzel|NLUCKELY YOU DON'T THINK  COULD WE HAVE FIRST STEP ON A LONG JOURNEY
358_david_patterson|COMPUTATION
358_dileep_george|ALSO SAGMENSDE MADE
358_jitendra_malik|WHAT DO YOU THINK THE SOLUTION WOULD LOOK LIKE
358_manolis_kellis|TO SENSE THINGS THAT WERE NEVER BEFORE SENSED
358_richard_karp|I DON'T THINK ANY CONSTANT FACT OR IMPROVEMENT
358_russ_tedrake|HE HOPED TO DO ONE DAY
358_sara_seager|ON THE GROUND PEOPLE ARE USING TELESCOPE SMALL TELESCOPES THAT ARE ALMOST JUST LIKE A GLORIFIED TELEPHOTA LENS ANDTHEYAR LOOKING AT BIG SWATHS OF THE SKY
359_david_eagleman|OU KNOW WHAT DONE
359_grant_sanderson|I GUESS VERY OFTEN THAT LIKE
359_ian_hutchinson|AH THAN FISHING
359_jitendra_malik|ANOTHER WAY ABOUT IT SO IKE IKE
359_kate_darling|BEING CLOSE TO ANYONE
359_richard_karp|CID
359_russ_tedrake|MEAN MY COMMUTE IS ALREADY A LITTLE CRAZY AND WHAT ARE WE TALKING ABOUT HERE
360_ben_goertzel|I'M GUESSING
360_david_patterson|THE COMPETER SAYS WE THE COMPETER HAS MORESE TO CHECK AND SAY  WE SCREWED UP WE MADE A MISTAKE
360_françois_chollet|MAROL WITH THE BEST TERM IS
360_grant_sanderson|THE GENIUS
360_jitendra_malik|AND COGNITION BRINGS IN ISSUES OF MEMORY AND
360_kate_darling|TO EXPLORE THAT THABT DOESN'T INTDOESN'T INTERFERE WITH THE HUMAN RELATIONSHIPS YOU HAVE IT EXPANDS MORE ON THE
360_peter_singer|I JUST DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH THAT EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE
360_sergey_levine|KIND OF ARBITRARY MADE UP STUFF
360_sheldon_solomon|MONEY AND WHAT JOHN GREY SAID IS THAT THAT WILL ENEVER TOBLE
361_david_eagleman|OH YE I MEAN IN THE SENSE THAT
361_dileep_george|DO ANSWER MALTIBLE QUESTIONS SO YOU'RE NOT TRYING TO BUILD A MODAL FOR JUST CLASSIFICATION OR JESTIC MUNDITION EXCERIT SAT SAY IT'S A
361_françois_chollet|IT WAS SEEN AS LIKE REASONING YES WOULD NOT BE LEARNING BASE YES IT WAS SEEN IT WAS CONSIDER THAT THE MIND WAS A COLLECTION
361_grant_sanderson|AND IS FASTENING TO SEE YE
361_ian_hutchinson|YOU MIGHT HAVE HEARD OF THE EXPRESSION THE SUPE OR MORE SIMPLY HYDROGEN BOMBS AU K
361_jitendra_malik|RIGHT NOW THE THINGS HA HAPPEN IN A CETAN ORDER YOU WALK IN
361_manolis_kellis|AND IN AW THE ABILITY TO SANSE COLLARS BY SORT OF CATCHING DIFFERENT PARTS OF THAT
361_robert_langer|MY STUDENTS YOU KNOW I MEAN I REALLY FEEL WHEN I LOOK AT THAT I MEAN WEITE POLLY HAND
361_steven_pressfield|THE SOURCE OF OF IDEAS
362_ian_hutchinson|CONFINEMENT
362_richard_karp|OF HOWTHEE
362_robert_langer|EAN A CLUS TER A THOUSAND STUDENTS GO THROUGH THE LAB AND
362_sheldon_solomon|IN LOCO
363_ben_goertzel|ECONOMIC VALUE IN GETTING FROM THAIROWAEE TOWARD THE
363_david_eagleman|AND IT IS DIFFERENT TO BE INSIDE THOSE HEADS
363_david_patterson|BREAKS WHICH IT CAN DO
363_grant_sanderson|TO CREATE AN ATMOSPHERE WHERE THE GENIUS CAN DISCOVER THEMSELVES
363_kate_darling|WILL E OTHER ESS O IFFERENT TYPES OF LONG TERM COMMITTED MONOGOMOUS RELATION SHIPS I THINK MONOGNOUS IMPLIES LIKE
363_peter_singer|THE DISPLAY
363_robert_langer|I MIN THEY HAVE DONE
363_russ_tedrake|TWELVE TIMES TWO
363_sergey_levine|THE FACT THAT YOL NUTWORKS ARE ABLE TO DISCOVER FEATURES IN THE CONTROL PROBLEM
363_sheldon_solomon|WHICH WILL NOT BE ATTRIBUTED
364_david_patterson|YOU KNOW IF YOU ARE NOT DOING ANYTHING LIKE BACKING IT UP TO GET SOME REDUNDANCY SO THO HANDLE IT YOURE YOURE YOURE TAKING GREAT RIST
364_dileep_george|AND EM SO SO THAT'S TE MOTAL THAT WE BUILT
364_grant_sanderson|LI HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY DO THE BEST WORK OF THEIR LIFE
364_ian_hutchinson|SO A BOMB ACTUALLY THERMINUCLEA BOMB
364_kate_darling|YOUARE NOT GOING TO SEE OTHER HUMANS INSEXUALLY OR
364_manolis_kellis|ADECIONAL SIGNALS FROM THE PHYSICAL WORLD THAN WE EVER KNEW BEFORE
364_peter_singer|OF THE WHAT WE CAN ACIND OF INTELLECTUAL SAY IS THA ATHAIC DISPLAY OF A SUFFERING IS NOT SUFFERING
364_robert_langer|WELL I THINK THAT'S A PERFECT WAY TO ENDED BOB THENK YOU SO MUCH O TALKIN IT I USHER IT WAS AN HONOR
364_russ_tedrake|ITS BABECAME A KIND OF A GAME OF HOW CAN I GET TO WORK
364_sara_seager|JUST LIKE A POINT OF LIGHT OR
364_sergey_levine|VERY INTERESTING AS HOPEFUL
365_ben_goertzel|UNTIL YOU GET QUITE FOUGHT FOUGHT FAR OUT INTO INTO THE FUTURE SO I THINK THAT'S VERY INTERESTING
365_david_eagleman|HOW PEOPLE BEHAVE AND WHY AND WHAT YOU CAN TELL ABOUT WHAT'S GOING OUTSIDE THEIR BRAIN
365_françois_chollet|AND THAT ABSORBS
365_jitendra_malik|SO I THINK THIS KIND OF A THIS KIND OF KNOWLEDGE IS ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL
365_manolis_kellis|AND AXCIONS FOR EXAMPLE HAVE BEEN ALL OVER THE NEWS IN THE LAST FEW WEEKS
365_russ_tedrake|I'VE ROLLER BLADED I'VE DONE ALL KINDS OF WEIRD STUFF BUT I MY FAVORITE ONE THESE DAYS I'VE BEEN TAKING THE CHARLES REVER TO WORK
365_sara_seager|AND SO TO FINE TRANSLITING PLANETS WE LOOK AT A
365_sergey_levine|'M NOT SURE WHAT TO THINK ABOUT IT BUT HE FEELS HOPEFUL
365_sheldon_solomon|IT WILL BE MISATTRIBUTED TO HAVE WHOEVER THE SCAPE GO DE JUR IS AND THE ANGER
365_steven_pressfield|OR DOES SHE RESIDE
366_kate_darling|SUPPLEMENTAL IN A DIFFERENT WAY BUT
366_matt_botvinick|YOU KNOW SOMEBODY PROFFERING THEIR HAND WOULD ELICATE
366_richard_karp|WILL NOT BE USEFUL UNTIL WE REALLY UNDERSTAND THE ORGANIZATIONAL PRINCIPLE BEHIND
366_robert_langer|HANKS FOR LISTENING TTHIS CONVERSATION WITH BOB LANGER
367_dileep_george|WHAT IS THET ALL O FIT BY CONNECTION
367_jitendra_malik|WE ARE GOING TO NEED TO DO THIS
367_joscha_bach|AND MINIMALIST AND NOT BEIN FLUENCED BY LIKES AND SO ON BUT IS PROBABLY VERY DIFFICULT TO AVOID THAT TO SOME DEGREE
367_manolis_kellis|WE CAN
367_matt_botvinick|YOU KNOW A HAND SHAKE A THE PREFRONT OF QUARTTEXAS WHAT ALLOWS US TO SAY ONO HOLD ON
367_richard_karp|THE NETWORK OF SWITCHES
367_sergey_levine|I GUESS MY QUESTION IS IS IT SURPRISING TO YOU HOW FAR
368_david_eagleman|ON THAT TOP AND HUT AYTHING ABOUT THIS GRAT AREA YE THIS IS EXACTLY THIS IS EXACTLY THE EVOLUTION THAT THINGS ARE GOING AS YOU KNOW HEWAS THECITRE AND THEN THERE WERE GUIDES
368_david_patterson|THINK THE STUDENTS THINK WIT THE SCAN
368_ian_hutchinson|WHICH THEN SETS OFF
368_jitendra_malik|I THINK THE KIND OF TYCHNOLOGY THAT WE HAVE RIGHT NOW WITH THREEDY CONVOLUTIONS OVER
368_joscha_bach|TSPEAKING AT A SMALL CHANGENT
368_matt_botvinick|THAT'S THE USUAL THING
368_richard_karp|E'LL LET'S JUMP INTO THE NETWORK OF SWITCHES AND TALK ABOUT COWMENATORIAL ALGARLEMS IF WE COULD
368_sara_seager|COUNTING UP THE BRIGHTNESS WE THO WE HAVE COMPUTER SOFT WARE IN COMPUTER CODE
369_david_patterson|RICHARD CARP ME RANDY CASSAN JOHN OSTERHOU A CONTEMPORARRS OF MINE I MENTIONED RANDY ALREADY
369_françois_chollet|ARE NOT CONSEMPTILIZING IT THAT WAY
369_ian_hutchinson|HYDROGEN ISOTOPES AND OTHER THINGS
369_robert_langer|LEASE CONSIDER SUPPORTING THE PODCASS BY
369_russ_tedrake|BUT FOR ME IT'S JUST A MAGICAL TIME
369_sara_seager|PURVIEU TO MAKE SURE THAT WE GOT THE PLANET CANDIDATES
369_sergey_levine|FORM SPECIALLY IN GAINS WITH RUTEA
369_sheldon_solomon|WE'RE GOING TO HAVE RIGHT WINGISH POPULIST  MOVEMENTS
369_steven_pressfield|OM MEG RYAN AND ON THE CATER JA A SEEN IT IP
370_david_patterson|ALL OF US ARE IN THE NATIONAL CANOMY OF ENGINEERING
370_dileep_george|GO FROM THE VIDRI VIRI TOP AND THEN ZUMEN OCAPAIN SO ONE IMPORTANT THING
370_françois_chollet|I ACTUALLYU HAVEN'T MET TOO MANY PEOPLE WHO BELIEVE THAT IN YOURAL NUTWORK
370_jitendra_malik|NOT THAT LONG DAM
370_joscha_bach|HOW CAN BE OW CAN TWUTER BE DONE BETTER
370_kate_darling|SO BETWEEN
370_peter_singer|THROUGH NATURAL LANGUAGE
370_robert_langer|DOWNLING CASHHAP
370_russ_tedrake|COMPRESS DEACOMPRESS AND
370_sergey_levine|ALFISTAR AND
370_sheldon_solomon|WHERE DAMAGOGUES WHO ARE THE ALCHYMISTS OF HATE WHAT MAKES THEM BRILLIANT
370_steven_pressfield|AND WRITE THE VISUAL OF THE MOVI SORT OF WAS
371_ben_goertzel|DIFFERENCE IN THE EVOLUTION OF HUMAN OR NONHUMAN
371_françois_chollet|WILL BE ABLE TO REASON
371_grant_sanderson|AND IF THERE'S ONE IT'S IT'S MEANT TO BE LIKE A CONCRETE
371_jitendra_malik|UNDERSTANDING LONGTIME UNDERSTANDING REQUIRES A NOTION OF
371_joscha_bach|SEEMED TO BE ABLE TO CONTROL THIS GAME
371_kate_darling|DIFFERENCE
371_manolis_kellis|BEFORE BECAUSE THAT ALSO TELLS US
371_matt_botvinick|BECAUSE WE HAVE
371_peter_singer|T THERE'S A THERE'S A FEELING THERE'S ANOTHER ENTITY THERE THAT SELF AWARE THAT HAS A FEAR OF DEATH A MORTALITY THAT IS A
371_robert_langer|AND USING COD LEX POT GAS
371_russ_tedrake|YOU KNOW ESPECIALLY I I'LL WAKE UP TO A LOT OF WORK IN THE MORNING AND THEN
371_sergey_levine|IN REGARD TO LIMITS A BET HERE
371_sheldon_solomon|IS THEY DON'T THEY DON'T THE HATES ALREADY THERE
372_david_eagleman|AMERICA HAS THE HIGHEST AND CARSERATIORADE IN THE WOLE WORLD
372_françois_chollet|LIKE SCALING SIZE EVENTUALLY MIGHT LEAD TO INCREDIBLE
372_ian_hutchinson|CAN GES SO KAN IM
372_jitendra_malik|AH THIS NOTION OF SCHEMERS THAT I TALKED ABOUT PERHAPS SOME NOTIONS OF GOL'S INTENTIONALITY
372_joscha_bach|OR CANEY
372_kate_darling|I KNOW YOU'RE THINKING OUT THER PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE A HUSBAND AND LIKE WHAT C WE GIVE THEM
372_matt_botvinick|AM REVOLUTIONARY
372_steven_pressfield|HART SURGEON
373_ben_goertzel|AND THEN TYCHNOLOGIES
373_françois_chollet|RESULTS TO US MERE HUMANS WILL APPEAR AS IF ITS GENERAL
373_grant_sanderson|NO MATTER HOW GOOD PEOPLE ARE AT SOMETHING
373_ian_hutchinson|EN SETS OFF
373_jitendra_malik|FUNCTIONALITY AND SOON ANSOFUT
373_joscha_bach|AT SORT OF A QUESTION ZERINY ADVICE YOU WOULD GIVE
373_manolis_kellis|PICTURE YOURSELF IN THIRTY TWENTY
373_matt_botvinick|A NEW TECHNOLOGIES FOR
373_robert_langer|BY ALL THE STUFF
373_russ_tedrake|OU YOULEADED LIKE A
373_sara_seager|UT THERE IS A GROUP CALLED PLANET HUNTERS AT ORK
373_steven_pressfield|AND HE'S WAITING TO TAKE OUT THE SOUL OF THE PRETY PATIENT ON THE
374_ben_goertzel|THAT HAVE DIRECT ABILITY
374_dileep_george|PERCEPTION AND COGNITION ARE INTERCONNECTED
374_joscha_bach|A UN I AVE CONTROL YOU SAY LICE BECAUSE I AM CERTAINLY NOT AN EXPERT BUT I CAN GIVE MY THOUGHTS ON THIS AND I
374_matt_botvinick|AM MONITERING MEASURING AND ALSO
374_russ_tedrake|GROUP OF PEOPLE
374_sara_seager|AND THEY TAKE THE DATA AND THEY ACTUALLY CROWDS ORE SET OUT TO PEOPLE TO LOOK FOR PLANETS AND THEY OFTEN FIND
374_sergey_levine|USHTHESE THS TO THE LIMIT
375_robert_langer|OF SKY BY YOU TWO
375_russ_tedrake|IS THERE DAYS WHEE YOE LIKE
375_sara_seager|FINE SIGNALS THAT URCOMPUTERS AND AUR TIMESTS
375_steven_pressfield|AND WE AND THERE TRYING
376_ben_goertzel|ARE ALSO VERY IMPORTANT FOR EXAMPLE
376_david_patterson|WHAT TE INSPIRES YOU OR YOU SEE INSPIRE THE STUDENTS
376_matt_botvinick|AND THESE TECHNIQUES ARE NOT
376_richard_karp|AND NEED TO BE ARRANGED TO FORE OM
377_dileep_george|IF YOU FINALLY WANT TO HAVE A SYSTEM THAT UNDERSTAND CONCEPTS
377_françois_chollet|IF YOU LOOK AT THE THE WAVES THAT OPEN THE EYES GIPUTUSTREAMMATAL IS MADE YOU SEE
377_grant_sanderson|YOU HAVE THIS TRUTH ABOUT PHYSICS AND THE WORLD
377_kate_darling|THER'RE STILL GOING TO BE DIFFERENCES AND THERE WERE IN THAT MOVI TWO LIKE TOWARDS THEND YO GO'S OFF THE RAIL THAT'S JUST THE MOVY SO THAT YOUR INTUITION IS A
377_manolis_kellis|THEN MY FRIEND DOESN'T APPEAR AND I'LL FORGET THAT I REMEMBER MY FRIEND
377_peter_singer|COULD LOOK AT THE PROGRAMME AND SEE WHETHER
377_richard_karp|OR SELECTED
377_russ_tedrake|IS ITERE
378_ben_goertzel|I DON'T THINK THAT'S CRITICAL TO ACHIEVE A G I BUT CERTAINLY YOU COULD SEE HOW THE RIGHT QUUM COMPUTING ARCHITECTURE
378_david_eagleman|EM IF HE TAKE SOMEBODY WITH A DRUG EDICTION WHOSE INJAIL FUR YOUNOTE BEING CAUGHT TWO OUNCES OF SOME ILLEGAL SUBSTANCE
378_david_patterson|I MEAN THAT IN GENERAL I THINK PEOPLE ARE SURPRISED
378_dileep_george|IS COMPATIBLE WITH YOUR COGNISSION SYSTEM AND LANGUAGE SISTEM AND ALL OF THEM AND ONE ASPECT OF THAT ES
378_françois_chollet|IT CAUSE OF THIS IDEA
378_grant_sanderson|INFUORY COULD BE KNOWN
378_jitendra_malik|TEND TO BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE TO FIND LEARNING WAYS OF DOING THIS
378_joscha_bach|THE ONCE THAT PUT YUSE THE MOST INTERESTING
378_manolis_kellis|FOR WAVES
378_peter_singer|WE CAN EXPLAIN THE BEHYVIAS IN A
378_sheldon_solomon|HAVING ADEQUATE RESOURCES TO PROVIDE A DECENT LIFE FOR YOUR FAMILY
378_steven_pressfield|LIKE TAPPING ON THAT WINDOW OVER THERE THEY'RE LIKE RIGHT OUT THERE AND THEY CARRY THE FUTURE THEY ARE
379_david_eagleman|AND YOU PUT HIM IN PRISON IT DOESN'T ACTUALLY FIX THE EDICTION DOESN'T HELP ANYTHING I'M
379_dileep_george|TOP DON CONTROLLABILIT
379_kate_darling|ITE SO ONE IS
379_manolis_kellis|THAT WE EMIT THAT ARE NOT EVEN AWARE OF
379_matt_botvinick|LET ALONE HUMANS
379_richard_karp|METIMY SOME COST FUNCTION
379_russ_tedrake|HE CAN ALWAYS SAY
380_françois_chollet|NO DAM
380_ian_hutchinson|LITTLE FUSION BOMBS ALONE WITHOUT THE SURROUNDING
380_joscha_bach|AND THE THING OFOUR SOCIA MEDIA IS COMMUNITIES THAT ARE UNHEALTHY OR WHATEVER YOU WANT IT IT DEFIES THESE SCENTIVES REALLY DON'T LIKE DYING
380_kate_darling|WHY WOULD YOU WANT
380_peter_singer|SUGGEST THAT SOME
380_sergey_levine|ND THEN WE'LL HAVE NO MORE DISHES TO CLEAN
380_sheldon_solomon|A WHO
380_steven_pressfield|AND IT'S NOT REALLY YOU
381_ben_goertzel|AGING AND UNDISEASE
381_david_eagleman|THAT HAS JUDGES AND JURIOUS WITH EXPERTEES IN MANTER ILLNESS BECAUSE IF YOU GO BY THE WAY TO A REGULAR COURT AND THE PERSON SAYS
381_dileep_george|YOU KNOW YOU CAN CLOSE YOUR EYES
381_grant_sanderson|SELF PROPORTIONALTY
381_ian_hutchinson|A FISHING
381_matt_botvinick|ITS ITS O VERY
381_richard_karp|COMMENTORIAL CONFIGURATION
381_sergey_levine|SO THRE 'S ALL SORTS OF SCAFFOLDING THAT A
381_sheldon_solomon|OFTEN BELIEVE OR THEIR FOLLOWERS BELIEVE ARE DIVINELY ORDAINED TO RID THE WORLD OF EVIL
382_ben_goertzel|WHILE NOT IN THE BIG PICTURE
382_david_patterson|AGAIN CONTINUE WITH REMENCE AT ESTIONS BUT WHAT HAVE YOU LEARNED ABOUT LIFE IT MAY BE EVEN SIZE FIRM WRESTLING OR FROM YETC
382_joscha_bach|WHITWOOD DO YOU THINK CENSORSHIP IS AN IMPORTANT TOOL
382_kate_darling|KAN A HEARD TO DO
382_richard_karp|SO AN EXAMPLE WOULD BE AM
382_robert_langer|THT WE'RAWFULLY LUCKY TO BE HERE
382_russ_tedrake|CRITICAL MEETING AND THEN THERE'S THIS DESIGND BEAUTY OF JUST RUNNING THE SIMPLICITY OF IT YOU ALONGE WITH NATURE
382_sheldon_solomon|ET I NOT EARNA SPACKER
382_steven_pressfield|AND PUTS IT IN I MEAN IN
383_david_eagleman|MOST OF THE JURIOS SAY I CALL BULSHON ON THAT WHY BECAUSE THEY
383_françois_chollet|YET SO I THINK WHAT'S INTRESSING AM UT YHOUD BE DISTREE
383_ian_hutchinson|SO ANOTHER APPROACH TO
383_jitendra_malik|IT'S POSSIBLE BUT I THINK IT'S NOT TO
383_richard_karp|COLERING THE VERTESES OF A GRAP WHAT'S A GRAPH
383_sergey_levine|AND ALL THAT IS KIND OF OUTSIDE OF THE CLASSICR NE FORESMORING PROM FORMULATION
383_steven_pressfield|THE ILIAT
384_david_eagleman|DON'T KNOW ABOTSCAS THEY DON'T THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT IT'S ABOUT AND IT TURNS UP PEOPLE WHO WH
384_david_patterson|IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE WERE STATE CHAMPION SAID ELCIMENO IN THE FACT I WAS TALKING TO BY MOM
384_dileep_george|YOU ARE OVICUAL KNOWLEDGE
384_matt_botvinick|PURSUED IN THESE OTHER ORGANISMS
384_robert_langer|TO ATTAIN ANY KIND OF LIFE IN THIS UNIVERSE OF OURS APPEARS TO BE QUITE AN ACHIEVEMENT
384_steven_pressfield|AND I'LL TAKE THE FORM OF HIS BROTHER
385_dileep_george|AH COGNITION DREMUN ME
385_grant_sanderson|EXPENENTIALLY PROVE THEIR TECHNOLOGY IN ONE DAY TAKE B TAKEN OVER BY THE AG I
385_ian_hutchinson|THE WEAPONS COMPLEX
385_joscha_bach|OF THE ANTIRY OF THE SYSTEM
385_kate_darling|I GUESS MY QUESTION IS ABOUT HUMAN NATURE
385_manolis_kellis|OF HUMAN COMMUNICATION
385_robert_langer|AS HUMANS WERE DOUBLY LUCKY OF COURSE
385_russ_tedrake|I THINK WORK YOU CAN FIND A WORK LIFE BALANCE IN THAT WAY I THINK HE JUST HAVE TO
385_sergey_levine|KIND OF SCAFFOLDING BUT ARE VERY IMPORTANT LIKE FOR EXAMPLE WHEREY DO YOU GET YOUR REWARD FUNCTION IF I WANT TO LEARN HOW TO POUR A CUP OF A WATER
386_david_eagleman|UH YOU HAVE JUDGENT URS WITH EXPERTIES AND MEN TO ILLNESS AND THEY KNOW THE REHABILITATIVE STRATEGIES THAT ARE AVAILABLE THAT'S WHONE THING HAVING A DRUG CORT
386_david_patterson|A LECTURE NEXT MONTH AND SO I'M WE'VE
386_joscha_bach|THE SHOULD BE BLOCKED AWAY WHILE LOCKED AWAY BLOCKED
386_manolis_kellis|THAT I DON'T THINK IT'S UNFATHOMABLE THAT OUR BRAIN HAS ACTUALLY VOLVED WEIGHS AND CENSORS FOR IT
386_matt_botvinick|I I'VE HAD MANY CONVERSATIONS IN WHICH
386_peter_singer|IS AUTONYMOUS IN OUR STATS TO DO THINGS ITSELF AND HIS AUTONYMOUS OF THE
386_russ_tedrake|I THINK I AM BETTER AT WORK BECAUSE I TAKE TIME TO THINK
386_sara_seager|OR THE RIVER YOU'LL HAVE LIKE LIQUID LAVA THERE' BE LIQUID LAVA LAKES ON THESE PLANETS WE THINK AND LIFE CAN'T C
386_sergey_levine|AH WELL HOW DO I KNOW HI'VE DONE CORRECTLY
386_steven_pressfield|CREATURES BEINGS ON ONE DIMENSION
387_david_eagleman|WE NEED TO BUILD ANOTHER JAIL AND THE THEY RUS GOD WE DON'T HAVE ANY MONEY WE CAN'T AFFORD THIS WE'VE GOT TOO MANY PEOPLE JO AND THAT'S WHEN THEY TURN TO
387_françois_chollet|I DEFINITELY DON'T BELIEVE THAT ITS INTELGENCE IS JUST A GIANTES STRATED MEMORY BUT IT MAY WELL BE A A BIG COMPENENCE
387_ian_hutchinson|BECAUSE IT'S MORE ASSOCIATED WITH THE TECHNOLOGISTS OF OF WEAPONS
387_jitendra_malik|SO THAT'S A REALLYSONING POINT
387_manolis_kellis|AWE HAVE NOWN CAPTURE WE DON'T UNDERSTAND THE FUNCTION OF THE VAST MAJORITY OF HER NIRANS
387_russ_tedrake|ON THE WA IN SO I PLANNED MY DAY AROUND IT
387_sara_seager|FACTOID IF YOU WILL IS THAT THE MOST COMMON TYPE OF PLANET WE KNOW ABOUT SO FAR
387_sergey_levine|AND IT SEEMS LIKE THEREIS NO
388_ben_goertzel|HEN A MARS CONY I IS ISGOING TO HAVE FOR QUITE SOME TIME BUT PERHAPS NOT AS MUCH AS AN AGII SYSTEM
388_dileep_george|IN ARYOS IN THE WOOD
388_françois_chollet|SO D'YOU THINK GIPIT THREE FOUR FIVE GIUPITI TEN
388_grant_sanderson|WITH SPACIATTO AND JUST
388_ian_hutchinson|IS INERCIAL FUSION SO
388_joscha_bach|OTH FOR THER INDIVIDUAL AND FOR SOCIETY AT LARGE
388_kate_darling|OF THE HUSBAND SO THAT REMOVING ANY OR THE SEXUAL STUFF ASIDE IS THE
388_manolis_kellis|AND MAYBE
388_peter_singer|QUITE POSSIBLE THAT ACTUALLY WE HAVE ACHIEVED
388_sara_seager|IN BETWEEN EARTH AND NEPTUNE SIZE IT'S TWO TO THREE TIMES THE SIZE OF EARTH
388_steven_pressfield|WHICH DEGREE
389_david_eagleman|A YOUNG PEOPLE TO GO INTO GOVERNMENT TO REVOLUTION AS DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF
389_david_patterson|BUT IN TERMS OF ME ETIT WAS A HUGE DIFFERENCE I WAS I WAS BOTH I WAS KIND
389_ian_hutchinson|GENERATING FUSION ALONE
389_jitendra_malik|THE TESTS OF OUR COMPETER VISION SYSTEMS ARE OFTEN KIND OF TRYING TO GET TO THE ADULT
390_jitendra_malik|SO WHAT KIND OF BENCHMARKS SHOULD WE HAVE
390_kate_darling|THE MYSTERY THE TENSION THE DANCE OF RELATIONSHIPS
390_manolis_kellis|MAYBE OR BRAIN IS NOT SENSING AT AT ALL
390_matt_botvinick|PROFOUNDLY TRIVIAL
391_ben_goertzel|CAN BE ONCE IT'S AS GENERALLY INTELLIGENT AS HUMANS IT CAN RAPIDLY BECOME MASSIVELY MORE GENERALLY INTELLIGENT
391_david_eagleman|WHEN MACHINE LEARNING PEOPLE COMPARE THE BRAME
391_david_patterson|AND I MATURED LATER ON IU NO OUR FAMILY PICTURE LATER SO AS ALMOST ALWAYS THE SMALLEST KY SO YOU KNOW I
391_kate_darling|YOU THINK WITH ROBARTS THAT'S DIFFICULT TO BUILL
391_matt_botvinick|I WILL CONCLUDE FROM THAT THAT MICE REALLY DON'T HAVE THE COGNITIVE FLEXIBILITY THAT WE WANT TO EXPLAIN AND THAT A MOUSE RESEARCHER WILL SAY TO ME WELL YOU KNOW HOLD ON
391_richard_karp|INTERCONNECTIONS BETWEEN
391_sergey_levine|AGAIN LIKE THE BOTTLE NECK IS
391_steven_pressfield|ND PUTTING IN THE TIME AND WAITING
392_ben_goertzel|THEN HUMANS AN AND THEN THAT THAT A G I
392_peter_singer|THE THEORY THE PHYSICS THE SCIENCE OF HALT WORKS
392_sara_seager|ELL ONE THOUGHT AND THIS IS MORE WHEN WE WANT TO BE RATHER THAN MIGHT BE
392_sergey_levine|IS THIS AN ALGRYTM QUESTION
392_sheldon_solomon|NOW HERE'S WHERE WE COME IN WHERE AGHAD
393_david_eagleman|A PASSAGE AT CPTI THREE HAS HAS WRITTEN AND THEY SAY WELL LOOK AT THIS AN IT'S PRETTY GOODRAY
393_david_patterson|SELF CONFIDENCE  TRANSLATED INTO
393_ian_hutchinson|GAW AND THAT IS HEREUP REALYFAST THAT IS INERTIAL FUSION
393_jitendra_malik|AND I THINK A THE
393_russ_tedrake|WAT A HAVE YOU
393_sara_seager|IS THAT THESE
393_sergey_levine|IS THIS A DATA SELECTION NIKE

394_jitendra_malik|THE CHALLENGE IS THAT WE SHOULD RALELY BE COLLECTING DATA OF THE TYPE THAT A CHILD A
394_joscha_bach|A TOTOLITARIANISM
394_peter_singer|EXACTLY SORT OF TRY TO REDUCE
394_richard_karp|OR INTERCONNECIONS INDICATING THE COMMUNICATION PATTERNS OF A HUMAN COMMUNITY
394_sara_seager|SO CALLED MANY NUPTUNES WE CALL THEM THAT THEY ARE WATERWORLDS
394_sergey_levine|QUESTION WOULD YE THINK HOW DO WE HOW DO WE NOT BREAK THOK TO ME DISHES
394_sheldon_solomon|PEOPLE JUST DISMISS THESE IDEAS IS FANCIFUL SPECULATION FOR WHICH THERE'S NO EVIDENCE
395_ben_goertzel|TELL THE ORIGIN STORY OF THE TURNEER SO YE I WOULD SAY I
395_david_eagleman|BUT WE ALSO NO
395_françois_chollet|MORTRASOMALEOS AND MORE TRAIN AT IS CAN ADDRESS TE FLOWERS AR GIPITISRE WHICH IS DAD
395_grant_sanderson|A LOT OF PEOPLE SEE THAT IS PRETTY OUT THERE AND IT'S LIKE NOT IN THE SHORT TURN FUTURE BUT
395_jitendra_malik|THAT THE CHILD EXPEDIENC
395_joscha_bach|AND DIVERSITY
395_manolis_kellis|GRATEFUL AND FEELING EXTREMELY LUCKY TO BE LIVING IN THE TIME THAT WE ARE
395_peter_singer|V TRY TO FIND WHETHER THER THIS THING IS CONSCIOUS OR NOT THE THINGHE IS INTELLIGUE OR NOT
395_sara_seager|THAT THEY COULD BE SCALED UP VERSIONS OF JUPITER'S ICY MONTHE
395_sergey_levine|YM AM WELL ONE WAY WE CAN THINK ABOUT THAT IS THAT
396_ben_goertzel|I LAUNCHD THE TERM ETIAI
396_jitendra_malik|SO IF HE COULD COLLECT THAT KIND OF DATA
396_joscha_bach|AS AS A SYSTEM I OF COURSE WE DON'T
396_peter_singer|ITS SIMPLY GIVING
397_david_eagleman|AND SO ON
397_dileep_george|DIFFERENTLY MODEL FROM
397_françois_chollet|ANYTHING ELSE OTHER THAN CROWSIBILITY
397_grant_sanderson|'YOU THINK WILL CALL  AS MARS ONE DAY
397_kate_darling|THAT EXHIBITS GREAT AND GREATER LEVELS OF INTELLIGENCE LIKE IMPRESSES US WITH ITS INTELLIGENCE
397_richard_karp|OPTIMIZING
397_sergey_levine|SO EPERHAPS PERHAPS IT'S TOO MUCH TO HOPE THAT
398_david_eagleman|OU KNOW I DO'T KNO IF YOU SPEAK A FRENCH OR SOMETHING BUT I'M NOTK TO STAR SPEAKING IN FRENCH CAUSE THEN YOU'LL SAY WAIY WHAT ARE YOU DOING I DON'T UNDERSTANDI INSTEAD
398_david_patterson|YOU KNOW COLLISION  KNOW SPORTS WITH PHYSICAL CONTACT LIKE WRESTLING OR FOOTBALL IN SUFFOK THAT PEOPLE ARE A LITTLE BIT MORE
398_dileep_george|THE TEXTAROF THE OBJEC
398_françois_chollet|RIGHT AH BECAUSE IT'S SIR IT'S IT'S ONLY GOL IS PLOSSIBILITY AND IT DOES NOWS IR CONSTRAINTS
398_jitendra_malik|DEVELOP LEARNING SCHEMES BASED ON THAT DATA THAT WOULD BE ONE WERTER DO IT
398_kate_darling|OU KNOW ARUMBA SO YOU TALK BY ETHOPOMORPHISATION THAT DOESN'T
398_matt_botvinick|ALL PARTS OF THE BRAIN ARE DOING THE SAME THING
398_peter_singer|AND CLEVERNESS AND  EMOTION
398_richard_karp|THE EFFICIENCY OF SUCH NET WORKS ORE
398_sara_seager|CONCENSEUS IS THAT WE NEED SOME KIND OF LIQUID
398_sergey_levine|YOU CAN HAVE A MACHINE
399_ben_goertzel|WHICH I PROVISIONALLY WITH TUDDLING REAL A I
399_david_eagleman|EVERYTHING COMING OUT OF MY MOUTH IS MEANT FOR YOUR EARS I KNOW
399_david_patterson|YOU KNOW ASSERTIVE OR SOMETHING AND SO I THINK A I THINK THAT ALSO COMES THROUGH HIS INOW IN
399_ian_hutchinson|IKE WHAT E MAKE
399_matt_botvinick|THIS FOLLOWS IMMEDIATELY FROM THE KINDS OF
399_russ_tedrake|NOW I I DO HAVE SOME FUN THINGS THAT I WILL TRY AND I LIKE TO
399_sergey_levine|IN ISOLATION IN THE VACUUM WITHOUT ANYTHING ELSE CAN JUST MASTER COMPLEX TASKS IN LIKE IN MINUTES THE WAY THE PEOPLE DO
400_david_eagleman|WHAT YOU'LL UNDERSTAND I KNOW THE VOCABITA THAT YOU KNOW AND DON'T KNOW I KNOW WHAT PARTS YOU CARE ABOUT
400_françois_chollet|NO UNDERSTANDING OF THE CONTENT OF THE QUESTION
400_richard_karp|THE PERFORMANCE OF SUCH THAT WERE EXSAM
400_russ_tedrake|HEN I TRAVEL I LMOST ALWAYS BIKE TOTHE LOGANAERPORT AND FOLD UP A LITTLE OLDING BYCON AND THEN  WITH ME AND BIKE
401_david_eagleman|THAT'S A HUGE PART OF IT AND SO OF ALL THE POSSIBLE SENTENCES I COULD SAY
401_joscha_bach|HERE IS NOT A SINGLE PLAN THAT IS GOING TO NOT START BECAUSE OF ME RIGHT IT'S NOT GOING TO HAVE AN INFLUENCE BUT I DON'T GET FOR ME TO BE
401_manolis_kellis|YOU KNOW THERE'S JUST THE SENSE OF EXCITEMENT ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE WORKING ON NOW
401_matt_botvinick|CHATTING ABOUT BEFORE
401_peter_singer|IS YU AH
401_russ_tedrake|CRAZY THINGS BUT DAM
401_sara_seager|YOU CAN'T REALLY MAKE ANYTHING AND SO WHEN WE THINK OF ALL THE LIQUIDS OUT THERE
401_steven_pressfield|SO THE CONSCIOUS PER ARTIST
402_ben_goertzel|COULD REALLY THINK IN THE SENSE LIKE PEOPLE CANOR R OR EVEN MORE BROADLY THAN PEOPLE CANDRIGT SO THEN I WAS REACHING OUT
402_david_patterson|YA A FRIEND OF MIE RANDY CAT SAID THIS HE SAID
402_françois_chollet|IN TWO DIFFERENT WAYS THAT ARE BYSICALLY ADVERSARELY A ENGINEERED TO PRODUCE SERTENANCER YOU WILL GET A A TWO DIFFERANCES
402_ian_hutchinson|THAT BIG EGOES
402_jitendra_malik|I WOULD BET ON
402_joscha_bach|LESS AM PUTTING THAT STRAIN ON THE ENVIRONMENT FOR INSTANCE
402_peter_singer|I WOULD SAY THAT IF WE HAVE SERIOUS DABTS EAND THINK IT MIGHT BE CONSCIOUS THEN
402_russ_tedrake|BUT NOT FOR THEM
403_david_eagleman|UM THAT'S THE NEXT SENTENCE THAT I NEEDED TO KNOW ABOUT FOR SOMETHING WELL OF COURSE IT COULD BE
403_ian_hutchinson|OF THE BIG LEADERS
403_jitendra_malik|THIS HIS LEARNING LIKE A CHILD ABROACH SO ONE OF THE
403_joscha_bach|NOTHING IN THIS WORLD IS
403_matt_botvinick|NORAL ACTIVITY
403_steven_pressfield|SONG RIDERS FOR A MILLIONEARS HAVE SAID YOU KNOW A SONG JUST CAME IN OF THEIR HADRIGHT WITH HALM JUST ALL I HAD TO DO IS RIGHT BUT THEN
404_david_eagleman|HERE'S THE THING SOMET THIN I DON'T THINK NOR OL NET WORKS CAN'T BE LIKE THE HUMAN RING AS I SUSPECT THEY WILL BE AT SOME POINT FIFTY YEAR YOU NOWH NOW BUT
404_françois_chollet|THE THEY'RE VERY GOOD A GENITING PROSSIPAL TEXT BUT THAT'S JUST THAT'S JUST NOT ENOUGH RIGHT IM
404_grant_sanderson|SAY WHY DO ANYTHING
404_ian_hutchinson|WHEN A RUBBING UP AGAINST EACH OTHER HAVE NOT CREATED A THE KIND OF DESTRUCTION ONE WAS A EVERYBODY WAS AFRAID OF OR DECADES
404_kate_darling|A EASIER THAN JUST SOLVING IT'S EASIER THAN SOLVING THE PURE NATURAL ANGUISH PROCESTING PROBLEM
404_peter_singer|WITH INSECTS IT'S MUCH HARDER TO BE
404_sergey_levine|AS HUMAN CONTROLL
405_ben_goertzel|FOLKS OUTED THE
405_françois_chollet|YOU NEED WL I THINK WAT ONE ONE AVENUE THAT WOULD BE VERY INTERESTING TO MAKE A PROGRESS
405_manolis_kellis|AND DUMB
405_richard_karp|OAM
405_sara_seager|THAT'S SO CALLED THOUGH
405_sheldon_solomon|OR HIS POLICIES ANY ROCK
405_steven_pressfield|SO I I DO THINK IT'S A PARTNERSHIP AND I THINK THAT
406_david_patterson|I WAS WRONG YOU ARE RIGHT
406_kate_darling|YHEU KIND OF ALLUDED THIS TOO WITH AUDIO DO YOU THINK IT MEANS TO HAVE A BODY
406_manolis_kellis|YOU KNOW I LIKE TO SOMEHOW DESCRIBE IT AS A LEANIER CONTINUATION OF ONE THING LED TO ANOTHER LED TO ANOTHER LIT T ANOTHER AND
406_matt_botvinick|WHEN YOU LOOK CAREFULLY AT FUNCTIONAL DIFFERENTIATION IN THE BRAIN
406_sara_seager|AND FOR AXIL PLANETS WE CAN'T STUDY REALLY COLD PLANETS CAUSE THEY'RE JUST SIMPLY TOO DARK AND TOO COLD
406_sheldon_solomon|IN CONTROL CONDITIONS
407_ben_goertzel|CALIFORNIA AND
407_ian_hutchinson|TO RESTRAIN
407_joscha_bach|THAT WE WOULD HAVE TO FOLLOW IN IF YE WANT TO STICK AROUND
407_richard_karp|YOU MIGHT WANT TOO
407_sheldon_solomon|UT IF WE REMINDED THEM OF THEIR MORTALITY FIRST
408_kate_darling|DOES IT GET IN THE WAY IS THERE A NEGATIVE ASPECT LIKE A
408_russ_tedrake|THING IN YOU OR YOU A I THINK IT'S BECOME THE OPPOSITE
408_sergey_levine|IN THE MOMENT OR NOT
408_steven_pressfield|REALLY UNSKILLED
409_ben_goertzel|BA NAW HAS BECOME RICH AND FAMOUS HE WAS ONE OF THE CELFOUNDERS OF OF GUGEL DEEP MINE BUEH AND THAT AT THAT TIME SHAME WAS A
409_dileep_george|TI THEY BECOME LEGALIZED THE DEGREE
409_kate_darling|YEMER YOU EVERYTHINGIN A TETTALK OR SOMETHING THAT CLICKED FOR ME
409_matt_botvinick|THE THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN REGIONS ARE ARE GRATED
409_russ_tedrake|IT'S A IT'S YOU'RE LIKE THAT DYNAMICAL SYSTEM THAT O THE WALK AR THE EFFICIENT DE ID SAD
410_ben_goertzel|HAVE JUST STARTED DOING HIS PEAH D WITH TA MARCAS HOOTER WHO
410_david_eagleman|ACTIVE THINKERS IN OUR WORLD AND DOING THINGS
410_david_patterson|LEAST CONSIDERS SUPPORTIN THE SPOTCAST BY GOING TO GEORGAN HARMANGER DOC COMSLASH LEX
410_françois_chollet|DO WHAT YOU WANT TO DO A IF YOU WANT TO
410_matt_botvinick|RATHER THAN BEING DISCREET
410_peter_singer|GETTING IT INTO TO A BROADR AUDIENCE
410_russ_tedrake|LEAVE NO PAIN CRID I LIT YU SHOULD END FEELING BETTER THAN YOU STARTED
410_sergey_levine|ACOW ESSENTIAL IS IT
410_sheldon_solomon|WE DID ANYTHING BUT BECAUSE WHAT THESE STUDIES MANY OF WHICH ARE NOW DONE
411_ben_goertzel|AT THAT TIME HADN'T YET PUBLISHED HIS BOOK UNIVERSAL A I WHICH SURELY GIVES THE MATHEMATICAL FOUNDATION FOR ARTIFICIAL GENERAL INTELLIGENCE TEL
411_david_patterson|OLANDIN CASH AP AND USIN COT LEX POT GAS
411_dileep_george|PROBABLY VERY LONG AWAIT T TO FIGURE HOW TO DO IT ETHICALLY
411_françois_chollet|A TURN JIBIDISRY INTO PRODUCTS YOU NEED TO PUT CONSTRAINTS ON IT
411_ian_hutchinson|FORTIES
411_joscha_bach|I THINK IT'S QUITE LIKELY THAT WE CANNOT CONTINUE LIKE THIS ALL OUR COUSIN SPECIES THE OTHER HOME IN ITS AGUN
411_kate_darling|CONSCIOUSNESS AND MORTALITY
411_richard_karp|CIRCUIT TO
411_russ_tedrake|IT'S MOSTLY I THINK AND COVIT HAS TESTED THIS CAUSE I'VE LOST MY COMMUTE
412_david_eagleman|WE'VE GOT TO BE MUCH MORE SOPHISTICATED THAN UNITS AND SYNNAPSES BETWEEN THEM
412_dileep_george|SO THERE'S THESE ALA LO LAV LA
412_françois_chollet|UNITS TO AN FORCE IT TO ABASIT AN ROLES SO YOU NEED AR WERE TO PROGRAMATE EXPLICITLY
412_grant_sanderson|SUREST KIND OF ARBITRARY BUT YOU CAN'T MOVE THE TARGET
412_ian_hutchinson|A FLORI
412_joscha_bach|TOTCHOS SO THAT THE RIGHT STEP WOULD BE TO WHAT TO REWINE
412_sara_seager|BUT WE CAN SEE GASES IN THE ATMOSPHERE
413_françois_chollet|ASSO IF YOU LOOK AT ITS ABILITY DO PROGRAMME SYNTHESIS
413_joscha_bach|TO WINE TOWARDS THE DUSTE REVOLUTION AND SLOWTHER THE THE SO TRY TO
413_manolis_kellis|AND THOSE MAMMALIAN ELEMENTS ARE ACTUALLY CONSERVED
413_matt_botvinick|AND THEN THEN THERE'S ANOTHER THING THAT'S POPPING UP IN VERY RECENT RESEARCH WHICH YOU KNOW WHICH
413_richard_karp|NO IF NOT A FEW WERE ARE PRESENT
413_sara_seager|IF IT'S A SMALL ROCKY PLANET
413_sheldon_solomon|THAT'S THE BALL GAME
413_steven_pressfield|AT PART OF ME THAT'S TRING SO HARD
414_ben_goertzel|THEY CONTRIBUTED PAPERS FOR THE BOOK
414_david_patterson|IF YOU ENJOY THIS THING
414_grant_sanderson|PROTECTING HUMANS FROM THE RADIATION IN SPACE
414_jitendra_malik|RADIUS ELBAN SPACES AND SOFORTH AND AS YOU MOVE YOU GET A PICTURE WHICH IS A PRETTY ACCURATE PICTURE
414_joscha_bach|TECHNOLOGICAL PROCESS THAT LEADS TO THE OVERCONSUMPTION OF RESOURCES
414_manolis_kellis|NINETY NINE PER CENT OF VIRGINO DOES NOT QUOTE FOR PROTIN
414_sara_seager|ND THIS IS GOING INTO SOME MORE DETAIL
414_sergey_levine|NEED TO BUILD MACHINES THAT CAN LEARN FROM REAL DATA BECAUSE THAT'S THE ONLY WAY THAT WILL GET THEM TO IMPROVE PERPETUALLY
414_sheldon_solomon|OM TAT SO
414_steven_pressfield|ANDAM
415_ben_goertzel|BUT THAT WAS MY PROVISIONAL TITLE BUT I NEVER LOVED IT BECAUSE IN THE END
415_david_patterson|SUBSCRIBED ON YOU TO BUT REVIEW IT WITH FIVE THOUSAND APOTCAST SUPPORTED ON PATRION OR CONNECT WITH ME ON TWITTER ALEX FRIEDMAN SPELLED
415_peter_singer|NOT COMPLETELY IDENTICAL BUT SOMETHING ANALOGOUS
415_russ_tedrake|I'VE BEEN LUCKY TO EXPERIENCE SOMETHING THAT NOT SO MANY RABODESIS HAVE EXPERIENCED
415_sergey_levine|BECAUSE IF WE
415_steven_pressfield|SO THESE ANGELS CAN SPEAK A LITTLE MORE EASILY THROUGH THE MEMBRANE CAN YOU
416_ben_goertzel|CANDECANDEME I RAY CURSWELL
416_david_eagleman|WE HAVE THIS VERY DEEP SENSE OF RELEVANCE THAT I MENTIONE EARLIER IS BASED ON SURVIVAL AT THE MOST BASIC LEVEL BUT THEN ALL THE THINGS ABOUT MY LIFE
416_dileep_george|AR SU SO SOME OF THOSE A CHALLENGES LIGANO THOUGH OBJECTICLY ORCOMPLETION CHALLENGES ARE
416_grant_sanderson|HEART PROBLEM DEMANDS INNOVATION YOU CAN'T MOVE THE GOAL POST TO MAKE THAT EASIER
416_jitendra_malik|YOU CAN IMAGINE THAT
416_matt_botvinick|PARTS OF THE BRAIN THAT WE WOULD HAVE PREVIOUSLY THOUGHT WERE QUITE
416_russ_tedrake|HANG OUT WITH SOME REALLY AMAZING
416_sara_seager|BECAUSE IT'S NOT INTUITIVE IN ANY WAY BUT WATER
416_sheldon_solomon|PAYING HOMAGE TO THE PHILOSOPHERS AND THEOLOGIANS THAT COME BEFORE US IS TO POINT OUT THE
416_steven_pressfield|PUT INTO WORDS THE PROCESS OF LETTING GO AND
417_françois_chollet|SERF
417_jitendra_malik|ANDA THEN
417_joscha_bach|BEFORE THIS SOME KIND OF NOMADIC SPECIES BES LIKE A MMILLION OR TWO MILLION AND SO YOU DON'T MEET NEW PEOPLE UNLESS YOU GIVE BIRTH TO THEM
417_peter_singer|WITH THE WI HUMANS
417_russ_tedrake|CONTROL THIRISTS
417_sheldon_solomon|LITERALLY SINCE ANTIQUITY
417_steven_pressfield|CLEARING THAT CHANNEL OF COMMUNICATION WHAT WOULD AS IT TAKE I TOOK ANOTHER GREAT QUESTION FFROM ME IT JUST TOOK
418_ben_goertzel|THAT SEEMED WEIRD TO ME BECAUSE
418_françois_chollet|AN OBSURBT I THINK USEFUL
418_ian_hutchinson|FROM THE LOOKS OF IT
418_manolis_kellis|UNTIL WE STARTED DOING THIS COMPARATIVE GENOMIC STUDIES
418_peter_singer|SEE THEMSELVES VISIBLY ANIMALS WE SEE OURSELVES AS
418_russ_tedrake|THE CLARITY OF THOUGHT THAT SOME OF THE MORE MATHEMATICAL CONTROL THEORY CAN BRING
418_steven_pressfield|TOOK PROBABLY THIRTY YEARS AND I KNOWN'T EVEN I WOULD I GUESS I WOULD LIKEIN IT TO MEDITATION EVEN AM NOT A MEDITATOR
419_françois_chollet|A AGIST INTUITION BUILDER IS A
419_ian_hutchinson|AS FORTUNATELY AS NOT AS BAD AS IT COULD IT POSSIBLY BEEN
419_matt_botvinick|LOOKING IN THE PRIMARY VISUAL QUARTAX WHICH IS CLASSICALLY THOUGHT OF AS
419_peter_singer|MORE IMPORTANT
420_ben_goertzel|IN THE COGNIVSCINCE LARATURE TO MEAN THE HYPOTHESIS THAT DIGENAL COMPUTER AIS COULD HAVE TRUE CONSCIOUSNESS LIKE LIKE HUMAN BEINGS
420_david_eagleman|I'M LOOKING AT NEW YORK ITY
420_dileep_george|KAN BE DONE VERY EFFICIENTLY AN IN A VERY DISTRIBUTED WAY
420_ian_hutchinson|AS CENTFUL HUMANS OF WHAT WORRIES YO THE MOST
420_jitendra_malik|SO YOU HAVE APIKSOME SITUATION AND NOW IN SOME SITUATION YOU PERFORM AN ACTION IN IT FOR SATIN
420_kate_darling|HAVE A DEEPER RELATIONSHIP HAVE A DEEPER CONNECTION SIGN OUR RELATIONSHIP IF IT'S FOR THEIR OWN BENEFIT THAT IF THAT SOUNDS CREATE
420_manolis_kellis|INTERESTING ABOUT THE GENO BY LOOKING AT THE ET A MALTIPLE
420_matt_botvinick|EVEN REGIONS WHOSE
420_peter_singer|DON'T NEED TO TAKE THEIR INTEREST IN OR CAT AT ALL
420_richard_karp|BE F
420_russ_tedrake|IS REALLY
421_ben_goertzel|SO THERE WAS ALREADY A MEANING TO STRONG A EYE WHICH WAS COMPLEXLY
421_dileep_george|BECAUSE IT IS WETTY THAT ARE SO MANY VIS OF REPRESENTING KNOWLEDGE
421_ian_hutchinson|IS IT NEW CLEAR WEAPONS
421_kate_darling|YE OR DATA COLLECTION OR I MEAN YOU COULD THINK OF GOVERNMENTS MISUSING THIS TO
421_matt_botvinick|PRETTY WELL DEFINED AT A COARSE TRAIN
421_richard_karp|THE CHALLENGES TO FIND THE MAXIMUM RATE AT WHICH THE ARE
421_russ_tedrake|IT REALLY HAD A BIG IMPACT ON ME AND ENDA
421_sara_seager|HYDROGENS ALIKE GAS AND WILL LEAVE FROM EARTHS LEAVE FROM THE PLANET
421_sergey_levine|FOR BEING ABLE TO UTILIZE REAL EXPERIENCE
421_steven_pressfield|AND
422_ben_goertzel|DIFFERENT BUT RELATED TO I SO
422_david_eagleman|DID' YOU THINK THERE'S IS THERES SOMETHING I NOW T THESE ARE MYSTERIES BUT LIKE
422_grant_sanderson|BY FORCING OURSELVES TO FIGURE OUT HOWTOCOLONIZE
422_ian_hutchinson|I AM CERTAINLY NOT CONFIDENT
422_kate_darling|EXTRACT INFORMATION FROM PEOPLE ITS
422_manolis_kellis|THE MATCHING REGIONS
422_sara_seager|SO ULTIMATELY IF YOU HAVE WATER
422_sheldon_solomon|ON THEIR DESK AND
422_steven_pressfield|FOR ME AT LEAST I THINK IT WAS JUST
423_grant_sanderson|THAT PLACE WOULD BE JUST INCREDIBLE JUS S WHAT PEOPLE LIKE THE INNERNET DIDN'T
423_ian_hutchinson|THAT MY CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN WILL EXPERIENCE THE BENEFITS OF CIVILIZATION
423_jitendra_malik|AY COQUETTE SMALL SKILL I KNOW IN THAT SMALL SKID AND BUT BUT THAT IS OF A
423_joscha_bach|PROBABLY TRIED TO PREVENT IT
423_matt_botvinick|MECHANISM OF VA COMMUNICATION IN THE BRAIN
423_peter_singer|A LOT OF THE THINGS
423_richard_karp|A SOURCE TO A DESTINATION
423_russ_tedrake|FELT REALLY GOOD AND ABOUT THE IDEAS THAT WERE FLOWING AND AND THE LIKE
423_steven_pressfield|BUT THERES DOESN'T SEEM TO BE ANY TRICK EVERYBODY WANTS A TACK THESE DAYS AND IDON'T THINK THERE IS A HACK
424_joscha_bach|WIT WEN BE WERE BORN
424_manolis_kellis|AND MAMMELS EVOLT FROM A COMANANCESTER ABOUT SIXTY MILLION YEARS BACK
424_sara_seager|Y ULTRA VIOLENT RADIATION
425_ben_goertzel|IT WAS EITHER SHAME LEG OR PETER VOSS
425_jitendra_malik|ANDA MY COLLEAGUE ALISAN GOPNIC HAS ETOGETHER WITH A COUPLE OF ATHERS SQUARTERS HAS A BOOK CALLED THE SCIENTIST IN THE CRIB
425_manolis_kellis|SO AFTER UNON DE
425_russ_tedrake|LATE AFTERNOON MEETING WITH A ONE OF MY FAVORITE CONTROL THEORISTS AND A
425_sergey_levine|VA OR
426_david_eagleman|YOUR AUNTS TO RECONNECT
426_dileep_george|RIDFORWARD PROCESSING CASCADE WITH HIS CALL
426_grant_sanderson|YOU WOULDN'T HAVE THE US GOVERNMENT FUNDING THAT JUST FOR THE FUNDS OF IT RIGHT
426_jitendra_malik|REFERRING TO THE CHILDREN SO I LIKE THE PART THAT I LIKE ABOUT THAT IS
426_manolis_kellis|METEOR THAT
426_russ_tedrake|AND WE WENT FROM THESE FROM THESE ABSTRACT DISCUSSIONS ABOUT MABIES AND WHAT FSAND AND WHAT A GREAT IDEA
426_sergey_levine|ANOTHER PROSPECTIVE REASON I THINK DISSIMULATION HYBOTESUS INTERESTING IS
427_ben_goertzel|G ISONEN
427_françois_chollet|WHAT WOULD HE THINK G P T WUD LOOK LIKE WHEN IT HAS A HUNDRED TRILLION PERAMETERS
427_grant_sanderson|AH THE QUOR PARTS OF ITS DEVELOPMENT WERE HAPPENING LIKE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE VEHIT NAT MOR WHEN THERE IS BUDGETARY CONSTRAINTS
427_joscha_bach|THAT WILL
427_manolis_kellis|WE HUMANS HAVE BEEN AROUND FOR
427_matt_botvinick|WHAT NURANS ARE DOING THERE'S YOU KNOW THEIRE'S
427_russ_tedrake|TO THE SUPER PRECISE
428_ben_goertzel|AND WHERE MAKES THE LOT OFYET WE USET FOR THE WESET FOR THE TITLE OF THE BOOK AND SO I THINK
428_dileep_george|IF YOU I YOU WANT AN INTUDIOR DYA WAT WHAT IS HAPPENING FATER DETICTORS ARE
428_jitendra_malik|WANTS TO BILL CAUSAL MODELS AND THE SCIENTISTS DOES CONTROL EXPERIMENTS
428_matt_botvinick|STILL UNCERTAINTY ABOUT WHETHER THAT'S AN A AN ADEQUATE
428_peter_singer|HNGS THAT WE DO TO ANIMALS
428_richard_karp|JUST LEARNING THAT
428_sheldon_solomon|IT BEHOVES EACH OF US
429_dileep_george|AH IN A DETECTING
429_ian_hutchinson|A A CONTINUALLY EXPANDING ECONOMY AND AND A AND CIVILIZATION IS IMPOSSIBLE
429_jitendra_malik|AND I THINK THE CHILD IS DOING THAT
429_joscha_bach|THAT MAY
429_sergey_levine|IS IT TO CREATE OT OF A VIRTUE REALITY GAME TYPE SITUATION THAT WILL BE SUFFICIENTLY CONVINCING TO US HUMANS
430_david_eagleman|AN IT DIED THIS
430_françois_chollet|NO I DON'T THINK SO
430_grant_sanderson|BUDGEIT FOR THE ARPINET AS THEY WERE DEVELOPING IT IM AND NOT JUST
430_joscha_bach|A LAWLESS TO
430_matt_botvinick|I IS
430_richard_karp|ALGARAZM YET DO NEFER NEVER FLOWS GATE TAUT IN
430_steven_pressfield|TOO WHEN HE HAD AN EXAMPLE OF A MEDITATION
431_kate_darling|YOU KNOW THESE SYSTEMS
431_russ_tedrake|I DON'T KNOW IT IT REALLY GETS ME I THINK
431_sara_seager|WHIT YOUR PERSONAL
431_steven_pressfield|HO IT'S ESSENTIALLY THEPRACTICE OF MEDITATION
432_david_eagleman|TURNS OUT OF GOT A BODY PLAN THAT'S DIFFERENT THAN WHAT I THOUGHT A FEW MINUTES AGO
432_grant_sanderson|IN SOME CALAMITOUS CIRCUMSTANCE WHERE
432_richard_karp|ANAGILAM NAMED AFTER YOU
432_sara_seager|YOU CANNA HAVE U A SENSE THAT THERE MAY BE A
432_sheldon_solomon|BOUT WHERE
432_steven_pressfield|IS OU I THINK SO SETING DRILL I THINK IT'S A GOOD WAY TO LOOK AT IT TOO BUT WHAT ARE YOU WHAT ARE YOU DRILLING YOU JUST SITTING
433_dileep_george|OF THAT AND MAKING IT INVADIENT TO LOCAL TRANSFORMATIONS SO THIS IS WHAT THE STRUCTURE OF CONVUSION EARNET WORK IS AM
433_ian_hutchinson|IN ORDER TO REACH STEADY STATE SEO TOO LEVEL
433_jitendra_malik|I HAVE HOPED  TSAID LASHIP THAT'S AN EXCITING POSSIBILITY IF WE CAN GET TO NOT JUST FOTO REALISTIC BUT
433_matt_botvinick|UM STUDIES THAT SUGGESTS THAT
433_russ_tedrake|AYBE THE POWER OF CLEAR
433_sara_seager|SOMEBODY LIVING OVER THERE
433_sheldon_solomon|THERE IS
434_ben_goertzel|IN FADER FOR ANYTHING GETTIN ON THE'S OBVIOUS
434_manolis_kellis|DIVERSIFICATION
434_peter_singer|TREATMENT OF ANIMALS
434_russ_tedrake|THINKING AND
434_steven_pressfield|YOU KNOW AND YOU AND YOU AND IN YOUR OTHER HATING MOMENTS WHERE YOU JUST CAN'T DO ANYTHING IND YOUSHINA FROM THE MOMENTS WHERE IT FLOWED
435_david_eagleman|WHICH IS A LIKE URNUS BECKERIS A PHILOSOPHER THE BASIS SAID DAD TA
435_françois_chollet|ALIBAL IMAGES
435_ian_hutchinson|WE NEED TO
435_kate_darling|MADY OTHERS THAT THE GARRET GREAT AREA IS
435_matt_botvinick|WITHIN THE DENDRIDIC TREE WITHIN AND URON
435_peter_singer|ALONG THE LINES OF SAYING
435_richard_karp|ALGRTHEM MPLEXITY
435_russ_tedrake|EEP LEARNING IS AMAZING
435_sergey_levine|IT KIND OF IMPLIES IT IT'S EASIER TO CREATE THE UNIVERSE THAN IT IS TO CREATE A BRAIN
435_steven_pressfield|YOU'RE TRYING TO COME BACK AND LOOK AND SAY WHAT WHAT DID I DO HOW DID HOW DID THAT HAPPEN WHAR WAS IN MY MIND YOU KNOW
436_ben_goertzel|ANNOYING IN A WAY BECAUSE
436_dileep_george|BUT IN ADDITION TO THAT IT IS ALSO STRUCTURED INAVY THAT IT IS GENERATY
436_jitendra_malik|THEY WERE FORCASSING ON VISUAL REALISM
436_joscha_bach|AND ITHINK IT IS NOT FUN TO BE VERY CLOSE TO NATURE UNTIL YOU COMPLETELY
436_kate_darling|THE REMOVING OURSELVESFOM CONSIDERATION OF LIGA
436_peter_singer|IF THE PINE IS JUST AS RIGHT AN ANIMAL THEN IT'S JUST AS BAD
436_richard_karp|IM YOU HAVE A SET OF INPUDATA
437_ben_goertzel|NO JJOSHABAC YOU YOU INTERVIEWED IS A CLOSE FRIEND OF MIND HE LIKES A TERM SYNTHETIC INTELLIGENCE
437_david_eagleman|AND SO I ATENOUGH IT'S SAS COMPELLING IS AN IDEA
437_dileep_george|SO THAT I AN CAN RUN IT BACKWARD AND COMBINE THE FORTWARD WITH THE BACKWARD
437_ian_hutchinson|THE AVERAGE ENERGY CONSUMPTION AND HENCIOTO OMISSION
437_peter_singer|AH THAT IT HAPPENS AS IF IT WERE A HUMAN
437_richard_karp|WHICH MIGHT FOR EXAMPLE BE AM
437_steven_pressfield|IT GETS A LITTLE BIT EASIER
438_grant_sanderson|BUT IN TERMS OF
438_ian_hutchinson|OF PEOPLE IN THE WORLD
438_jitendra_malik|THIS FORWARD DIRECTION NOT JUST FOR OPTICULE INTERACTIONS BUT ALSO FOR PHYSICAL INTERACTIONS
438_kate_darling|A AND AND THEN JUST
438_matt_botvinick|HAVING SAI DAT
438_richard_karp|AH A SET OF VERTISES CONNECTED BY EDGES WITH
438_sheldon_solomon|AS LIKE ALL WE'RE GOING TO WRITE A BOOK AN MAYBE UT WE'LL GET TO GO ON TEEVE OR SOMETHING
439_david_eagleman|BUT HOW THAT EXPRESSES ITSELF IN YOUR LIFE ENDS AT BEING VERY ON THE REASON YOU DO WHAT YOU DO
439_dileep_george|IT HAS LACAL CONNECIONS
439_françois_chollet|A NOT JUST BY TRAIN LIKE IF YOU TRAIN ON MORE
439_grant_sanderson|HOW MANY FOCUSED SMART HOURS OF HUMAN
439_joscha_bach|A BASY DIVE FORESTS THAT DON'T HAVE ANYTHING IN THEM THAT EATS US
439_kate_darling|YOUARE ONLY INDIRECTLY RESPONSIBLE
439_matt_botvinick|I FEEL LIKE WE CAN GET I FEEL LIKE
439_richard_karp|BEINYOURE GIVEN FOR EA CHEDGE THE CAPACITY OF THE EDGE
439_russ_tedrake|MORE RIGOROUS THINKING THAN I THINK
439_sara_seager|THE CANER BASE TI THE BASE
439_sergey_levine|HAT SEEMS TO BE
439_sheldon_solomon|NO THAT'S NOT THE SAME
439_steven_pressfield|WHEN WHEN YOU READ SOMETHING YOURATE
440_ben_goertzel|THEN TOOLS AND IN A WAY I DON'T LIKE THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN ARTIFICIAL
440_david_eagleman|OR SURVIVAL FOR IMMORTALITY
440_dileep_george|THIS LATEL ANCIOUSNESS
440_jitendra_malik|OF COURE SOME OF THAT IS GREATY COMPUTE AN TENSIE
440_manolis_kellis|YOU CAN TAKE THE GENUMS OF ALL THESE SPECIES AND ALLINE THEM ON TOP OF EACH OTHER
440_matt_botvinick|THAT AMERBE READING SOME
440_peter_singer|WE WOULD BE ABLE TO COMMUNICATE WITH ROBOTHS SOME RETURNING TO SIT OF A SMALL PARALLEL BETWEEN PERHAPS ANIMALS AND THE FUTURE AA
440_richard_karp|ANDUM
440_sheldon_solomon|AS TO ACTUALLY THINK ABOUT IT
441_david_eagleman|IN BECAUSE AS HUMANS WERE NOT JUST AABOUT SURVIVAL WERE AWARE OF THE FACT THAT WERE GOING TO DIE
441_ian_hutchinson|IN THE WEST IN AMERICA AND EUROPE AND SOFOOL
441_kate_darling|IN PEOPLE'S INTERESTS AND WHEN THOSE INTERESTS ARE LINE THAT'S GREAT UM BUT
441_manolis_kellis|CREATE NUCLITIDE RESOLUTION CORRESPONDENCES
441_matt_botvinick|VAGUE PAPER SOMEWHERE RECENTLY WHERE THE MECHANICAL SIGNAL
441_richard_karp|YOU HAVE FOR ALCRYTMS WHICH ARE I THINK OF THEM AS COMPARETIVE PROGRAMMES WITH
441_russ_tedrake|YESO THAT'S REALLANG YOUR THINK SO UNDERSTANDING LIKE FUNDAMENTALS THE FIRST PRINCIPLES OF THE
441_sheldon_solomon|IN A WAY THAT IT
441_steven_pressfield|NO I THINK I DO NOW
442_david_eagleman|WHICH IS A VERY KIND OF WERL WEARLI U SPACE OR IT BY THE WAY AREN'T
442_joscha_bach|BEING CLOSE TO NATURE
442_matt_botvinick|THE VIBRATIONS OR SOMETHING OF THEE
442_richard_karp|ASED ON THOSE OPERATIONS
443_david_eagleman|ARRANT AINT CONFUCIUS SAID A
443_dileep_george|ER SOMETHING BETWEEN THESE EDGES WHICH IS OTHE NOSES REPRESENTING THES EDGES WHICH IS TO ENFORCE COMPATIBLYLY BETWEEN THEM
443_grant_sanderson|AGAIN IKE HE CIRCUMSTANCE IS MACAB BUT I THINK THAT'S ACTUALLY PRETTY HEALTHY
443_jitendra_malik|SENSATION PERCEPTION AND COGNITIONCE WAS THIS SENSATION YES
443_manolis_kellis|YOU CAN SEE THAT WITHIN PROTING CROTING GENES
443_richard_karp|WHICH WILL DETERMINE IN A MINIMUM NUMBER OF
443_russ_tedrake|HOW THING BEHAVES LIKE ALL THE FORCES INVOLVED
443_sergey_levine|SO IF THEY HAVE PRIOR EXPERIENCE OF TTRACTING WITH PEOPLE AND THEY CAN LEARN FROM THEIR OWN EXPERIENCE F ATTRACTING WITH PEOPLE FOR THIS NEW TASK MAYBE THAT'LL BE ENOUGH
444_ben_goertzel|WITHIN THE DOMAIND OF COMPUTATION THEORY WHICH HAS LIMITED BUT INTERESTING SO IF YOU SUME COMPUTABLE ENVIRONMENTS AND COMPUTABLE REWARD FUNCTIONS
444_dileep_george|SO THE WISE WORDLE HAPPENIS I CONSTRAINTS IT'S A CONSTRAINT IT'S BYSICALLY IF YOU IF YOU DO JEST FEATURE DEDICTION
444_françois_chollet|ENRIDGE OR REFINE YOUR LIVELS
444_ian_hutchinson|LESS INEQUITY IN THE WORLD
444_jitendra_malik|WHAT CAN WE LEARN FROM IMAGE STATISTICS THAT WE DON'T ALREADY KNOW
444_joscha_bach|NOT JUST YOUR GOAL BUT YOUR WHOLE EXISTENCE
444_manolis_kellis|HERE'S A PARTICULAR PATTERN OF EVOLUTION THAT IS DICTATED
445_ben_goertzel|THEN HE ARTICULATES WHAT WOULD BE A TRULY GENERAL INTELLIGENCE
445_françois_chollet|ER IN AN UNTEMENTED WAY
445_joscha_bach|IS A E
445_kate_darling|I THINK THEY ACTUALLY THERE'S A LOT OF MONEY TO BE MADE BY DOING THE RIGHT THING FOR SOCIETY LIKE THAT
445_peter_singer|WHETHER THERE IS CAUTIOUSNESS WHETHER
445_richard_karp|AND THE ANSWER TO THE PROBLEM IS LET SAY THE UM
445_russ_tedrake|FROM PHYSICS THE FIRST PRINCIPLE THING COME FROM PHYSICS AND HEAR IT'S LITERALLY PHYSICS
445_sergey_levine|THE DEMULTIAGINT OR ACTION THE THE ABILITY TO UNDERSTAND THAT OTHER
445_sheldon_solomon|ID I WAS JEST LIKE WAITA MINUT
445_steven_pressfield|YOU KNOW HE HE
446_françois_chollet|DESCORRECT
446_grant_sanderson|AND SAY MAKE THIS REAL PHYSICAL THING HAPPEN
446_ian_hutchinson|SHARE THE ENERGY RESOURCES MORE UNIFORMLY
446_matt_botvinick|BUT I DON'T THINK THEY CHANGES THE STORY E BUT IT'S ALMOST A INTERESTING
446_peter_singer|OR MORE IMPORTANTLY WHETHER THERE IS CAPACITY TO SUFFER
446_richard_karp|THE CONFIGURATION OF THE NETWORK THAT CARRIES SOME MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF FLOE
446_sergey_levine|A BEINGS IN THE WORLD HAVE THEIR OWN GOALS AND TENTRONS AND THOUGHTS AND SO ON
447_david_eagleman|EARLY ON
447_dileep_george|ENFORCING THE THE TANFOMISSIONS IS A WHOLE THING STILL DE FEREN SERIBLE
447_françois_chollet|YOU EVE A HOPE FOR AM I ARE NOT YOU'RE FAMILIAR WITH THAT DEA OF A SEMANTIC WEB
447_joscha_bach|HAT IS A FULFILLING EXISTENCE
447_kate_darling|WE I DON'T THINK WE KNOW WHAT'S GOOD FOR SOCIETY IN TERMS OF A
447_russ_tedrake|NOT JUST I MEAN IT APPLIS SO CLEANLY AND ENRHOBOTICS BUT IT ALSO APPLIES TO JUST IN ANY DETISA
447_sergey_levine|WHETHER THAT KIND OF UNDERSTANDING
447_sheldon_solomon|IN IN ORDER TO ASSUAGE DEATH ANXIETY
448_grant_sanderson|YOUNG FINEMAN SITTING THERE KIND OF INVENTING A
448_ian_hutchinson|THE SIO TOO EMISSIONS IN
448_jitendra_malik|A HER IS THAT
448_manolis_kellis|AND A CHANGE THE THIRD
448_peter_singer|THAT'S ONE QUESTION AH
449_david_eagleman|WAS LIKE THE REASON IT'S BEEN SUPPRESSED AND THAT THE REASON MOST PEOPLE WHEN I ASKED THEM ABOUT WHETHER THEY'RE AFRAID OF DEATH THEY BASICALLY SAY NO
449_jitendra_malik|THERE'S A LOT OF REDUNDANCY IN THESE IMAGES
449_joscha_bach|A THERE IS PROBABLY SOMETHING LIKE AN INTERMEDIATE STAGE
449_richard_karp|THE NUMBER OF VERTESIES THE NUMBER OF EDGES AND SO ON
449_sara_seager|THEN IT WILL BE FAR AWAY BY DEFINITION
450_david_eagleman|WHAT THAT HELD THIS THING ENDS
450_dileep_george|INFRANCE ON THE FLY
450_ian_hutchinson|NOT BY A FACTOR OF TEN BUT BY A FACTOR OF A HUNDRED ANOTHER WIS HAS TO GO DOWN TO ONE PERCENT OF WHAT IT IS NOW OCASE
450_joscha_bach|VERSES A SOMETHING LIKE THIS VERWE NOW HAVE BUSY A BIG MACHINE
450_kate_darling|SHOULD IT SHOULD WE EMOTIONALLY MANIPULATE YOU INTO HAVING A DEEP CONNECTION WITH ELEXA
450_manolis_kellis|THE SAME I MUNOCID WILL BE UNCOTED
450_matt_botvinick|WHAT WE DO WHEN WE BUILD ARTIFICIAL NARROW NETWORKS OF THE KIND THAT
450_peter_singer|FIND OUT IF THE AGIA HAS
450_richard_karp|THE NUMBER OF BASIC COMPUTATIONAL STEPS GROWS ONLY A SOME FIXED POWER OF THAT SIZE
450_sheldon_solomon|HOW DID HE FACE HIS
451_grant_sanderson|FOR THE THINGS YOU'VE CREATE WHICH ARE QUITE SINGULAR
451_kate_darling|EVERYGY OF OPTIMISM THAT WILL BE ABLE TO SAW SOMETHIS CORRETIOUSWELL
451_manolis_kellis|SO THAT BASICALLY MEANS THAT ANY KIND OF MUTATION THAT PRESERVES THAT TRANSLATION
451_peter_singer|A SENSE OF ITSELF
451_sergey_levine|SOMETHING THAT I THINK I IS A COMMON A KIND OF PITFALL WHEN THINKING ABOUT
452_ben_goertzel|BEFORE EVEN THE TERM EXISTED REPRESENTING A KONT OF COMMUNITY
452_david_eagleman|LIKE MOST PEOPLE AS OF AVENCONTER DO NOT MEDITATE ON THE IDEA THAT LIKE
452_joscha_bach|IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE WHETHER IN YOUR OWN LIFE OR IN THE HISTORY OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE THAT YOU HAVE COME ACROSS
452_kate_darling|I'M GOING TO SAY SOMETHING THAT'S CONTROVERSAL LI IN MICIRCLES WHICH IS THAT I DON'T THINK THAT
452_matt_botvinick|IS THAT WE
452_richard_karp|AND ALGRYTHMS
452_steven_pressfield|I THINK A REALLY SKILLED ETTER WHICH JOHN IS
453_ben_goertzel|CAN YOU MAY BE GIVE YOUR SENSE OF THE HISTORY OF THIS COMMUNITY
453_david_eagleman|RIGHT NOW YOU COULD DIE
453_dileep_george|WHAT ARE CAPTURES BY THE WAY A MIP YEU BY THE WAY ONE MOST AWESOME LIKE THE PEOPLE DON'T USE THIS TERMING IN MORSE HUMAN COMPUTATION I THINK
453_kate_darling|WELL MEANING EVEN WITHIN COMPANI'S UM
453_richard_karp|WHOSE RUNNING TIME IS BOUNDED BY SOME
453_russ_tedrake|PEDESTIAN BEHAVIOR
453_sheldon_solomon|CLAIM TO BE A ATHEISTIC A DID NOT IDENTIFY
453_steven_pressfield|UNDERSTANDS WHAT WHAT MAKES A STORY TICK AND HE ALSO HAS THE PERSPECTIVE THAT I'VE LOST IN SOMETHING I'VE WROTE CAUSE I'M SO CLOSE TO IT
454_ben_goertzel|AS IT EXIST TO DAY AS IT EXISTED BEFORE THIS DEEP LERNING REVOLUTION ALL ALL THROUGHOUT THE WINTERS AND THE SUMMERS OF A
454_david_eagleman|IN LI IT IN IN THE NEXT FIVE MINUTES IT COULD BE ALL OVER
454_françois_chollet|I WAS KIND OF A DREAM
454_jitendra_malik|HO O I FRELL I SO I MEAN THAT THE A WAY TO THINK ABOUT IT IS JUST
454_joscha_bach|MODELS AT AN ARBITRARY DERY DEGREE OF DETAIL RATE OF THE WORLD
454_kate_darling|I THINK THAT WHAT WE DO ABSOLUTELY NEED IS
454_steven_pressfield|TO SAY YOU KNOW THIS YOU KNOW THIS ISN'T WORKING AND AND THAT IS WORKING
455_ben_goertzel|SURE AFIRST I WOULD SAY
455_dileep_george|LINE THE REACEN CAPTAS IXIST IS BECAUSE YOU KNOW
455_françois_chollet|FOR AH
455_grant_sanderson|THAT RIGHT THERE I THINK ITS THE BIGGEST PART OF MY LIFE THAT I WOULD LIKE TO CHANGE IN SOME WAY THE
455_joscha_bach|WHY
455_kate_darling|OTHER SOLUTION I THINK
455_manolis_kellis|ERE'S A ET OF SEQUENCES THAT IN COTE
455_peter_singer|WOULD I SURVIVE WHAT WOULD SURVIVE HAD A BET SOR ELICITIVE ON THAT LINE
455_richard_karp|THAT'S SUPPOSE TO BE
455_russ_tedrake|I FELLI I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND
455_sara_seager|THE MEASURES THE THE PROPER MEASURES OF THEIR INTELLIGENCE
455_sergey_levine|IN MANY CASES
455_sheldon_solomon|TO CHRISTIANITY BUT WAS HIMSELF
456_françois_chollet|I THINK THE THISMETICOT PAPERS AND THE NINETIES IT'S KIND OF THE DREAM THAT TH
456_grant_sanderson|AH II LOOK AT
456_ian_hutchinson|AND YOU DON'T THINK THEY RE REBES DEBRESSME NOWESS LESS ANIG SA IT IT'S NOT THAT IT'S NONE IT'S NOT DEPRESSING IT SAL
456_joscha_bach|DO YOU THINK THIRES THERE IS AN ANSWER WHY WHY IS THERE SUCH A SEARCH FOR AN ANSWER WHAT SO DOES THERE HAVE TO BE LIKE AN
456_matt_botvinick|CONSTITUTE REASONABLE A MODELS OF HOW A BRAIN WOULD WORK
456_peter_singer|ANOTHER PERHAPS ABSURD QUESTION BUT DO YOU THINK
456_richard_karp|RELATIVELY FAST CLASS OF ALGORTHMS THAT'S RIGHT WE THERITITIANS TAKE THAT TO B
456_steven_pressfield|SEE WHAT YOU'RE DOING BUT YOU CUL DO BETTER NO HE DOESN'T DO THAT LOOK AT BUT THA LOT OF IT IS ABOUT UM
457_peter_singer|HAVING A BODY IS NECESSARY FOR CAUSCIOUSNESS SO
457_steven_pressfield|JANRA AND KIND OF THE DEFINING WHAT JAN ARE YOU WORKING IN
458_david_eagleman|IT IS CERTAINLY MOTIVTING WHEN WE HINK ABOUT THAT
458_dileep_george|MILLIONS OF ACCOUNTS A AN THE
458_joscha_bach|UNDERSTAND THE WHY OF WHAT THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND ITSELF
458_kate_darling|THU THOSE ARE MOSTLY SECRETIF
458_peter_singer|D' YOU THINK DIGIAL BEINGS CAN SUFFER
458_richard_karp|COUD HAVE AN ALGRITHEN WHOSE RUNNING TIME IS THE TEN THOUSANDTH POWER OF THE SIZE OF THE INPOT AND THAT WOULDN'T BE
458_sheldon_solomon|WHAT DOES THAT MEAN WELL THIS IS THE OF FAITH
459_david_eagleman|O KY I'VE GOT SOME DEAD LAND ANEXACTLY WHEN IT IS BUT I BETTER MAKE STOFTHING HAPPEN
459_françois_chollet|THE KNOWLEDGE ON THE WERE PREVAILABLE TO MACHINES THE EXTREME A SOMETHING CLOSER TO UNSUPERVISE DEE PLEANINGS
459_grant_sanderson|MAGIC THAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU RUN INTO EACH OTHER
459_kate_darling|THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THESE COMPANIES TO ON
459_manolis_kellis|ALL OF THE PUSSABLE DEONA AND CODINGS OF PARTICULAR FUNCTION AND THAT FUNCTION
459_peter_singer|SIMPLY DIGINAL BEINGS NEED TO BE
459_russ_tedrake|I MEAN THE LEARNNG HUMANS ARE INVOLVED NOT JUST BECAUSE HUMAN BY I THINK EM
459_sergey_levine|IT JUST FEELS LIKE THAT THERE MIGHT BE A SPACE OF MANY LOCAL
460_dileep_george|E DEIR SISTOM IS HAVING
460_ian_hutchinson|HRE IS NO TECHNOLOGICA SOLUTION
460_jitendra_malik|COMPRESSION OF THE KIND WHEN I SEE A PICTURE OF A CAT
460_matt_botvinick|DEEP LEARNING RESEARCH AS AS IT'S BEEN APPLIED TO NURA SCIENCE OF COURSE
460_peter_singer|YOUR HARDWEREIS NEEDS IS GETTING WORN OUT WE'RE GOING TO TRANSFER YOU TO A FRESH PIECE OF HARDWAY SOVERGANNA
460_richard_karp|REDUCING FROM AN ENSQUARED ALGRETM TO AN ENLOGAN OR LINEAR TIME
460_sara_seager|DO YOU THINK THERE ARE THINGS
460_sergey_levine|A LOCOMINOMINE TERMS OF THEORIES OF THIS WORLD THAT WE WOULD DISCOVER AND GET STUCK ON
460_sheldon_solomon|HE WAS IZVIEW ON THE AFROLANEHE WAS A AGNOSTIC GONTA
461_ben_goertzel|STEADY GROWTH IN ADVANCE OF ADEAS AND AND AND PAPERS AND
461_dileep_george|IS WI TA HUMAN SO IT SAY IT'S CALLED A HUMAN INTRACTION PROOF A CAPTURES THE HUMAN INTRACTION PROOF A SO
461_françois_chollet|THEN THE SEMANTIC QUAR WAS
461_ian_hutchinson|THE CHALLENGES SOCIETY THE CHALLENGES
461_jitendra_malik|O EBUSTE JAS TO LINGER ON THAT FOR LITTLE BIT
461_joscha_bach|IS THE CONTINUOUS TRYING OF UNDERSTANDING ITSELF
461_manolis_kellis|SEQUENCE AT TA PROTING LEVEL YOU CAN THINK OF THE SAD OF PROTINSEQUENCES AT ALL FULFIL THE SAME FUNCTION
461_sara_seager|I STILL LOVE SEDY SEARCH RECTS OR TRUSTRIAL INTELLIGENCE
461_sheldon_solomon|BUT HE DID INOT THE DENIAL DEATH
462_david_eagleman|OH I WANT TO
462_grant_sanderson|IT'S NOT IT'S NOT IN THE DATA DAY IN THE SAME WAY
462_jitendra_malik|A YOU MENTION
462_kate_darling|MAKES SOME SORT OF DECISION THAT AFFECTS SOME ONE'S LIFE THAT
462_sara_seager|THERE'S NO STRUCTURE WE FELT THAT
462_sergey_levine|EASY TO COMBYE
463_ben_goertzel|A FUNDING FOR ARTIFICIAL TELSIS RESEARCH AND I WOULD SAY
463_dileep_george|HINKS THAT ARE EASY FOR HUMANS TO SOLL
463_françois_chollet|GIBUTI THREE
463_russ_tedrake|BUT I THINK THERE'S A RIGOROUS THINKING THAT IS JUST AN ESSENTIAL SKILL FOR A
463_sara_seager|INTELLIGENT CIVILIZATIONS COULD SEE FROM FAR AWAY THERE'S LITERALLY NOTHING NOT EVEN THE GREAT WALL OF CHINA
464_ben_goertzel|CORRELATION BETWEEN FUNDING
464_françois_chollet|HASN'T LEARNED
464_kate_darling|YE FOR SOME OF THE WAYS THAT THESE SYSTEMS ARE ALREADY BEING USED I THINK IT IT IS PRETTY IMPORTANT THAT PEOPLE UNDERSTAND HOW THEY WERE
464_matt_botvinick|THE UNITS DEEP IN THE SYSTEM ARE DOING
464_russ_tedrake|MATHEMATICIAN OR ENGINEER THAT AM
464_sara_seager|AND SO TO THINK LIKE WHY WOULD THIS OTHER CIVILIZATION BUILD A GIANT STRUCTURE THAT WE COULD SEE
465_david_eagleman|A THA CONUL NULWIRK DOES NOT FEAR ITS MORTALITY
465_dileep_george|WILL BE UNSOLABLE EVEN NOW BUT
465_françois_chollet|A THING
465_grant_sanderson|A ONE OF THE MANY AH
465_sara_seager|BECAUSE YOU WANT TO TELL THEM YOU'RE HERE
465_sheldon_solomon|A MATURE INDIVIDUAL AN IF YOU WANT TO LEARN SOMETHING YOU GO TO THE UNIVERSITY UN
466_david_eagleman|SET OF
466_dileep_george|WITH THE TECHNIQUS THAT WE HAVE DEVELOPED IT CAN BE AND F YOU CAN QUICKLY DEVELOP A MACANSOM THAT
466_jitendra_malik|IN THE CARGASO COMPEREGA RIGHT THAT'S E SO TO DAY WHAT WE HAVE ARE
466_joscha_bach|SO YOU DON'T THINK THAT'S A FUNDAMENTAL
466_matt_botvinick|WHAT THEY'RE DOING RESEMBLES WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT WHAT NARANS DEEPEN THE BRAINS ARE DOING AND
466_peter_singer|IS A IS THAT INTERESTING TO YOU AS AS THE EXPANSION OF THE HUMAN MIND
466_sara_seager|HOW DO YOU MAKE PROGRESS
466_sergey_levine|IS EXCEPTANLLY POWERFUL IN  THE CONDUCT WHERE IT COULD BE APPLIED
466_steven_pressfield|BUT SINCE HE WAS
467_françois_chollet|BURTER THAT MIGHT BE JUST E EARLY DAYS YE I THINK THAT'S CORRECT I THINK THE FORMS OF PRISONING THAT YOU THAT YOU SIT BEFORM ARE
467_jitendra_malik|IN A ARRAY INTERESTING SYSTEMS BECAUSE THEY WORE COMPLETELY BOTTOM UP
467_manolis_kellis|ONLY INFECT BATS
467_richard_karp|PRACTICAL SOLUTION
467_sheldon_solomon|MATURE INDIVIDUAL ACCORDING TO CURKGARD YOU GOT TO GO TO THE UNIT YOU GOT TO GO TO THE SCHOOL OF ANXIETY
468_françois_chollet|ASICALLY JUST REPRODUCING PATEONS ITIT A SIN STRAIN EIRA SO OF COURSE E SHALL TRAIN ON A
468_grant_sanderson|AM THAT HE SCETLED A MEETING AND THAT THE TITLE OF THE WHOLE MEETING WAS
468_ian_hutchinson|WERE CHRISTIANS AND I THINK IT WAS THAT
468_manolis_kellis|AR AS A HOST AND A SUPSET OF ONLY FOUR OR FIVE HAVE EVER INFECTED HUMAN
468_peter_singer|I WANT BETTER ACCESS TO MY MEMORY I HAVE TO SAY TOO IS YET ALL DAY YOU KNOW YOU
468_sergey_levine|BEAUTIFUL TO YOU THAT THIS MECHANUTS WORK AS WELL AS IT DOES AND ALSO CAN BE GENERALIZED TO OTHER CONTACTS
468_steven_pressfield|PUBLISHING YOU KNOW
469_ben_goertzel|THEORETICAL PAPERS TO
469_david_eagleman|AS THEY SEEM TO GENERATE GOULS
469_dileep_george|AH IF YOU WANT TO UNDERSTAND HOW HUMAN PERCEPTION WORKS AND YEARN TO BUILD
469_matt_botvinick|AM THE LEARNING OUTRHYTHMS THAT WE HAVE AXIS TO WHICH
469_russ_tedrake|DO MY PART TO TRY TO STEER
469_sheldon_solomon|REALLY
470_ben_goertzel|WORKING IMPLEMENTATIONS
470_françois_chollet|EVEN IMAGINE YOUAD I AM
470_grant_sanderson|JUST FOR THE STRANGERS YOU MIGHT MEET JUST A STRANGERS OR STRIKING UP A CONVERSATION WITH STRANGERS ON THE TRAIN EAT HARDER TO DO
470_ian_hutchinson|A TWO PEOPLE
470_kate_darling|WRITTEN DOWN IN SOME
470_richard_karp|IN THIS THEORY AM
470_sergey_levine|OR ANYTHING THAT'S APPLICABLE TO THE REAL WORLD
471_ben_goertzel|EARLY WITH REGARD TO THE CARINDUSTRY SO IT DIDN'T CATCH ON SUCH AS HAS HAS HAPPENED NOW BUT I M EAN
471_david_eagleman|MENTION EARLIER IF YOU DON'T MIND GOING BACK WHICH IS THIS WHEN WE ARE TUNGEN RABSI AY
471_ian_hutchinson|HO WERE REALLY SMART LIKE ME
471_jitendra_malik|AM NOT HAPPY WIT
471_kate_darling|TANGIBLE FORM IS AUTOMATICALLY COPYRITED
471_manolis_kellis|THE LAST LITTLE OPEN READING FRAME THE LAST LITTLE JEN IN THE JINA IS BOGIS
471_matt_botvinick|YOU KNOWE PATTERNS OF ACTIVITY PATTERNS OF RESPONSE
471_richard_karp|WHEN WE MEASURE THE COMPLEXITY OF AN ALGRYTHM
471_sergey_levine|I THINK THAT IAM
471_sheldon_solomon|BASICALLY
472_françois_chollet|A INDISTRESSIO IN IT
472_ian_hutchinson|AM GIVING YOU MY YES MY IMPRESSION WE SOY AT THE TIME THE WAY I AWAY I FELT AT THE TIME IM
472_jitendra_malik|EITHER OF THESE JARCES FULLY
472_joscha_bach|DENIAL OF DEATH THAT IN ALL THIS THIS KIND OF A
472_kate_darling|DOES IT IN A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT WAY UM
472_sergey_levine|IT'S A VERY INTERESTING IDEA
472_steven_pressfield|BUT YOU YOURSELF EDIT DISWELL
473_ben_goertzel|WAS PRETTY MUCH INDEPENDENT OF AI MILITARY
473_dileep_george|SHOW EM ANY NEW CAPAPTUR THAT WE CREATE THEYWILL BE ABLE TO SOLVE IT
473_grant_sanderson|IKE A LOT BAK
473_ian_hutchinson|AND AND THEY THOUGHT CHRISTIANITY MADE SENSE AND AND YOU KNOW T
473_jitendra_malik|WE HAVE GONE INTO A BECAUSE WEHAVE COMPLETELY SEPARATED THESE PROCESSES
473_peter_singer|PRESUMELY IT'S IT'S POSSIBLE TO DO THAT AN
473_russ_tedrake|WORE ITS EASY TO GET LAZY
473_steven_pressfield|THE RULES
474_ben_goertzel|SUMMERS AN N WINTERS IN THE EU SO THAT THERE HAS BEEN MORE GOING ON IN AAI GLOBELI
474_dileep_george|SICKIN IN O SU
474_ian_hutchinson|TESTIFIED TO ITS SIGNIFICANCE IN THEIR LIVES AND SO THAT WAS AN IVERY IMPORTANT INFLUENCE ON ME
474_kate_darling|AT THIS POINT WE SHOULD REALLY HAVE SOMETHING BETTER BUT WE DON'T
474_matt_botvinick|META LEARNING SO WHAT IS META LEARNING META LEARNING IS
474_peter_singer|I KNOW THAT T AR PEOPLE WHO THINK THAT THERE'S A REAL DANGER THAT WE WON'T THAT WILL MORE OR LESS ACCIDENTALLY LOSE CONTROL OF
474_russ_tedrake|AND NOT DO THE RIGOROUS THINKING AND THE OTHER QUESTION I HAVE IS LIKELY OF ADVICE
474_sheldon_solomon|YOU DIDN'T CHOOSE THE TIME O PLACE O YOUR BIRTH YOU DIDN'T CHOOSE YOUR NAME YOU KNOW YOU DIDN'T CHOOSE NECESSARILY E
475_dileep_george|FEIN ON WHATEVER YOU WANT
475_grant_sanderson|YOU LOOK AT THIS AND
475_jitendra_malik|AT THE PROCESS
475_kate_darling|DO LIKE COPEN SOURCE YE EYES OPEN SOAS GOOD FOR SOCIETY
475_matt_botvinick|BY DEFINITION
475_peter_singer|MY DEAR DO YO AE LEFT HER YOU ARSELF PERSONALLY
475_richard_karp|BUT IF THERE IS ANY CASE WHERE IT GETS INTO A VERY LONG COMPUTATION
475_sheldon_solomon|WE NEED TO REALIZE THAT WE'VE BEEN LIVING
476_grant_sanderson|SAY LIKE THIS IS THE WRONG WAY
476_joscha_bach|BEING COGNIZANT ON YOUR MORTALITY AND
476_kate_darling|THINK ALL THE SHULD OPEN SOURCE CODE WELL
476_manolis_kellis|LIGHT A TINY LITTLE
476_matt_botvinick|A SITUATION IN WHICH
476_richard_karp|THAT WOULD INCREASE
476_steven_pressfield|CAUSE IT'S SO PAINFUL TO MAKE THOSE MISTAKES YOU REALLY FEEL LIKE OT I WISH I COULD
477_françois_chollet|YES WHICH IS WHY YOU KNOW AAA SYSTEM THATSA
477_joscha_bach|TH FEAR OF THAT MORTALITY AND THA YOU CONSTRUCT ILLUSIONS ON TOP OF THAT
477_manolis_kellis|ADETIONAL GENE AND COTED WITHIN THE OTHER GEN
477_matt_botvinick|YOU HAVE A LEARNING HOUR IN THEM
477_russ_tedrake|I MEANT THE
477_sergey_levine|REWARD FOR AGEN YOU NOW GOOD REWARD FUNCTIONS
478_david_eagleman|IN AUDITORY QUARTEX
478_dileep_george|IN THE ENTERTRAINING CERA
478_jitendra_malik|AT DESTIME AT RUN TIME THOSE PROCESSES ARE NOT BURELY FEED FORWARD BUT THEY INVOLL FEET BACK
478_joscha_bach|HIGGIRSOME
478_kate_darling|UM WE HAVE AN OPEN SOURCE DEFALT BECAUSE WHAT WE'VE NOTICED IS THAT
478_manolis_kellis|SO YOU CAN TRANSLATE AT DIANY SEQUENCE IN THREE DIFFERENT READING FRAMES
478_sara_seager|TWENTY PER CENT OF THE ATMOSPHERE HAS OXYGEN NOW
478_sheldon_solomon|EN AND WE AFT A MOMENTARILY
479_françois_chollet|I SMY OT OF CARTINUE SLOANING
479_jitendra_malik|WHILE IN
479_kate_darling|PEOPLE COME AN THE LIKE
479_manolis_kellis|IF YOU START IN THE FIRST ONE IT'S IN NO EIGHTY G ET CETERA IF YOU TERN O THE SECOND ACE T G C ET CETERA AND
479_matt_botvinick|IN SUCH A WAY THAT IT
479_sheldon_solomon|DISPOSE OF THAT
479_steven_pressfield|AND NOT ONLY DO THEY CRITICISE THE WRITING
480_ben_goertzel|WES THIST ASTOUNDINGLY
480_dileep_george|THE MAGIC OF HUMAN PERCEPTION AND DAKOVSTATER OF PUT THIS AR VERY BEAUTIFULLY IN AAN OFFICE A
480_ian_hutchinson|ONE IS THAT
480_jitendra_malik|IN THE BRAIN IN THE VISUAL CORTEX GOING FROM THE RETINA TOITI MAY BE BE AVE LIKE SEVEN
480_manolis_kellis|WITH THERE'S A TE GEGINE WITHIN A GINE
480_matt_botvinick|GIVES RISE TO ANOTHER LEARNING ALRYTHM
480_peter_singer|IS THERE ANY FUNDAMENTAL REASON THAT WILL NEVER ACHIEVE
480_sergey_levine|YOU MEAN JUST THAT AS TIS A CURIOUS OBSERVATION TO SEE US OUT OF CREATIVE THOUGH THIS O
480_sheldon_solomon|ND SO NOW KIRKAGARD SAYS WELL HERE I AM I I HAVE
481_ben_goertzel|BORING AND SEEMED WRONG HEADED TO ME IT WAS REALLY LIKE
481_françois_chollet|WET OR LIN IT BE
481_grant_sanderson|AND I KNOW THAT SUJUST A THING THAT I'M NOT GOOD AT
481_jitendra_malik|LATE TI THEIR FARE CHALLEUR
481_manolis_kellis|SO THERE'S A WHOLE OTHER PROTIN THAT WE DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT
481_richard_karp|BERE WHERE WHEN CONFRONTED WITH A SOLUTION YOU CAN CHECK IT IN POLONOMIAL TIME
481_sara_seager|HAETHERS

481_steven_pressfield|STARTING OR DOING THE WORK
482_ben_goertzel|SOMEHOW THE SYSTEM HAS GOT TO BE AUTOMADIS LEARNING RAIT SHEN ME LEARNING FROM EXPERIENCE AND THE E I FEEL THEN WAS NOT INTERESTED IN
482_dileep_george|IS WHAT IS THE LETTER
482_joscha_bach|AS O AS THE ACCIDENTIALIST THOUGHT TO OUR EXISTENCE  I THINK THAT THE FEOVNA HAS ONLY PLACE A ROLE
482_matt_botvinick|YOU START WITH JUST ONE LEARNING OW GRYBTHM AND THEN ANOTHER LEARNING OW GRYBTHM KIND OF
482_russ_tedrake|MENTAL MODEL BUT SOMETHING LIKE INVERTING AMATRIX YOU KNOW II THINK WE KNOW HOW TO DO THAT
482_sara_seager|PEOPLE PROBABLY CAN'T EVEN TELL
483_david_eagleman|ANND UM
483_kate_darling|A REFERENCE TO BABY BOUHT
483_manolis_kellis|SO WE DON'T EVEN KNOW THE BUILDING BLOCKS OFF
483_matt_botvinick|A THAT'S THE IDEA OF MEDOR LEARNING YOU IT IT RELATES TO THE OLD IDEA IN PSYCHOLOGY OF LEARNING TO LEARN
483_russ_tedrake|UNDERSTANDING THE
483_sheldon_solomon|THING I AT THIS POINT KIRKAGARD SAID YOU'RE REALLY DANGLING ON THE PRECIPICE
484_ben_goertzel|SOME RESEARCHERS CERTAINLY WERE
484_ian_hutchinson|AND THAT
484_jitendra_malik|AH IT TO DEAL WITH THE MORE AMBIGUOUS STIMULI
484_kate_darling|A WHAT HAVE YOU LEARNED ABOUT RHOBADICS AND A I FROM
484_manolis_kellis|SO IF WE WON'T UNDERSTAND KORONOF OURS BIOLOGY AND EVENTUALLY FIND IT SUCCESSFULLY
484_richard_karp|AH SO YOU HAVE FAT
484_sara_seager|WHEN WE SAY WE'RE DESTROYING AND OLD GOBLEWORMING ALL THAT KIND OF STUFF
484_sergey_levine|ANTICIPATE
484_sheldon_solomon|OF OBLIVION AND SOME PEOPLE TUMBLE INTO THAT ABYSS
485_kate_darling|RAISING A HUMAN BABY BUT
485_matt_botvinick|OUR UNDERSTANDING HOW META LEARNING WORKS
485_peter_singer|OF COURSE WHEN YOU SAY EVENTUALLY
485_sergey_levine|UNEXPECTED
485_steven_pressfield|THAT'S ANOTHER GREAT QUESTION I MEAN IN IN JEWISH MYSTICISM
486_ian_hutchinson|HE PERSON OF JESUS CHRIST SO ALL THOSE THINGS WITIY MEAN BY PERSONAL CONNECTION AND WHY THAT WAS MOCRET
486_richard_karp|AND SQUARED
486_sheldon_solomon|IT WAS FAITH IN CHRISTIANITY THAT YOU CAN'T HAVE UNBRIDLED FAITH IN CULTURAL CONSTRUCTION ST
487_david_eagleman|REALITY AND ASI YAND THEN OF COURSE WHAT I'M REALLY INTERETED IN HIS CENSORY
487_ian_hutchinson|SO AS IN SIZE FOR THE STUPID LATTER HAS NO LOCADE NO PROEM AS A CHRISTIAN I BELIEVE THAT I HAVE A RELATIONSHIP WITH GOD
487_jitendra_malik|THER SOLUTION IN
487_joscha_bach|IT SEEMS LIKE THERE ISE SO MUCH
487_manolis_kellis|TE TE CACOV I NINETEEN ELA BIT MORE LIKE HOW WHAT'S YOUR SENSE ABOUT THE
487_matt_botvinick|WELL YES A WE THE ORIGIN OF THAT PAPER WAS IN
487_peter_singer|THIS BEGIN TO BE A HUNDRED YEARS IN THE FUTURE
487_sergey_levine|FUNCTIONS SIREVIR
487_sheldon_solomon|THE ONLY THING THAT YOU CAN HAVE UNEQUIVOCAL FAITH IN
487_steven_pressfield|HAS A COMPLETELY DIFFERENCE
488_david_eagleman|HA IS HE CAN PICK UP ON STUFF
488_dileep_george|IS TO MAKE THESE CHARACTERS CROWD TOGETHER
488_françois_chollet|SOMETHERE CERZI MILLION
488_kate_darling|HOW THESE SYSTEMS ARE GOING TO SHAPE THE WORLD THAT HE GROWS UP IN AND SO I'M
488_manolis_kellis|N ALSO
488_russ_tedrake|I THINK A
488_sergey_levine|THERE ALWAYS TO MITIGATE THAT ONE WAY TO MITIGATE IT UST ACTUALLY DEFINE AND OBJECTIVE THAT SAYS LIKE DON'T DO WEIRD STUFF
488_sheldon_solomon|IS SOME KIND OF TRANSCENDENT POWER
489_ben_goertzel|FANCY LIKE
489_françois_chollet|A DIFFEREN ROD SITUATIONS WERE ACTUALLY COMPLETELY INSUFFICIENT TO TRAIN A DRIVING MODEL
489_kate_darling|IKE EVEN MORE CONCERNED ABOUT
489_peter_singer|IT SEEMS UNLIKELY THAT THERE'S ANYTHING MUCH WE COULD DO NOW
489_steven_pressfield|AS FROM THE SELF THE EGLO BELIEVES
490_grant_sanderson|YOU KNOW WHAT THEY DO LIKE WHAT THEY EAT WHEN THEY WAKE UP
490_jitendra_malik|A SHOULD BE PURSUED FURTHER
490_joscha_bach|SO IF YOU WANT TO APLOW IT IS VERY EASY YOU MAKE ING MACHINE AT THINKS IT'S YOU
490_manolis_kellis|IKE THA D IF THE IMPORTANT PROTEENES AN
490_matt_botvinick|USING STANDARD REINFORCEMENT LEARNING AUBRHYTHMS
490_richard_karp|JACK EDMONS AND I WERE THE FIRST TO SHOW THAT IT COULD BE DONE IN TIME INCUBED
490_russ_tedrake|A TRYING TO WRITE DOWN EQUATIONS OR
491_ben_goertzel|HE WORKED WITH EEN WITTON THERE AND THEY LAUNCHED
491_dileep_george|THEY ARE INOD THA THERE IS VERY STRONG EVIDENCE FOR IT BEING
491_françois_chollet|A ILLAMOS
491_jitendra_malik|A SOME KIND OF RECURRENCE MECHANISM YE
491_kate_darling|MASS OF AMOUNTS OF DATA COLLECTION FOR EXAMPLE
491_peter_singer|I AM ALL IN FAVOUR OF SOME PEOPLE DOING RESEARCH INTO THIS TO SEE IF INDEED IT IS THAT FAR OFF OR IF WE
491_sara_seager|SOMETIMES WALKS THAT LINE A LITTLE BIT
491_sheldon_solomon|JUST ANOTHER DEATH DENYING BELIEF SYSTEM
491_steven_pressfield|EGO BELIEVES THAT DEATH IS REAL
492_kate_darling|AS YOU GAN TO BE ALLOWED TO USE LIKE FACE BOOK OR A THE FASE BOOK IS OVER
492_matt_botvinick|ASK WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU GIVE IT
492_sara_seager|AH THERE IS SO MUCH EXCITEMENT ABOUT EXETRETHROUG LIFE AND ALIENS
492_steven_pressfield|THE EAGLE BELIEVES THAT TIME AND SPACE ARE REAL THE EAGLE BELIEVES THAT
493_ben_goertzel|OPEN SOURCE MACHINE LEARNING TOOL CATE WHICH WAS LAUNCHED IN
493_dileep_george|BUT GLOVELI
493_ian_hutchinson|MYSELF INCLUDED BELIEVE THAT PRAYER IS
493_jitendra_malik|AT DESTIME OQ THEN A TRAINING TIME
493_peter_singer|WE CAN REDUCE THAT RISK
493_richard_karp|NOW TO ILLUSTRATE THE CLASS AN P
493_russ_tedrake|IKA IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND SOMETHING ABOUT THE SYSTEM MATHEMATICALLY
493_sergey_levine|NOANNE I DO THINK THAT THI'IS A PROBLEM THAT'S THAT'S IMPORTANT TO FIGROUND
493_sheldon_solomon|BACKER ADMITS
494_dileep_george|DHO THE EXPLANATION THAT FITS TOGETHER IS SOMETHING THAT IS DIFFERENT FROM WHAT HE FIND LOCALLY
494_grant_sanderson|'M NOT A SOFER ENGINEER BUT SOMETHING IN THE DIRECTION OF SOFHOR ENGINEERING SOME DAYS IS LIKE
494_joscha_bach|BUT THEN THEN THENCE THEN YOU CAN BE IMMORTAL BY THE CONTINUITY OF THE BELIEF
494_richard_karp|QUESTION IS HOW LONG WOULD IT TAKE TO AM
494_steven_pressfield|SELF ON THE OTHER HAND THE GREATER SELF THAT BUTTS UP AGAINST THE DIVINE GROUND BELIEVES THAT DEATH IS NOT REAL
495_david_eagleman|THAT'S ALL THEY PICK UP ON THAT'S THEIR OWN VELT
495_dileep_george|O SO S THIS IS
495_françois_chollet|AND FOR I
495_grant_sanderson|A VARIANT OF RESEARCH IS LIKE LEARN THIS TOPIC WELL AND TRY TO LEARN IT DIFFERENTLY
495_ian_hutchinson|OKE TO ME I DON'T MEAN NECESSARILY ORLY IN WORDS BUT SHOWED ME THINGS OR ENLIGHTENED ME OR INSPIRED ME
495_joscha_bach|ETHER YE CANNOT BE IMMODAL BUT YOU CAN A STOP BEING AFRAID OF YOUR MORTALITY BECAUSE YOU REALIZE YOU WERE NERVE A NEVER CONTINUOUSLY EXISTING IN THE FIRST PLACE
495_manolis_kellis|FOR EVERY ONE OF THESE PROTINS
495_matt_botvinick|A FORM OF METAL LEARNING SPONTANEOUSLY HAPPENS IN INRECURRENT NORAL NETWORKS AND AN
495_peter_singer|MY DISAGREEMENT WITH SOME OF THESE PEOPLE WHO TALK ABOUT LONGTERM RISKS EXTINCTION RISKS
495_russ_tedrake|UT I THINK THAT'S THE GOOD STUFF
495_steven_pressfield|THAT TIME AND SPACE ARE NOT REAL THAT THE GODS TRAVEL SWIFTEST THOUHT
496_dileep_george|INFERENCE YOU ARE BUSILY TAKING
496_françois_chollet|IT'S PROBABLY AT SHIVERBORN EL FIVE PROBLY KNOUGTS WAS THE DISTINCTION THERE IS ELPHITE IS COMPLETELY IF CAN JUST FALL ASLEEP
496_grant_sanderson|AT GOES RESEARCH SCCRIPTING
496_ian_hutchinson|IN WAYS AM THAT AM I
496_joscha_bach|ONCE ADONOPH I BE MORE TERRIFIED OR LESS TERRIFIEDBLE THAT IT SEEMS LIKE
496_kate_darling|THAT MAKES IT THAT'S A SOCIAL ROBOTAN NOT JUST ELECA LIKE
496_russ_tedrake|THAT I UNDERSTAND THE FUNDAMENTALS
496_sara_seager|IT'S GREAT TO SEE PEOPLE
497_david_eagleman|THE SIGNALS THEY GET FROM THE WORLD FROM WHICH TO CONSTRUCT THEIR REALITY AND THEY GET BE TOTALLY DIFFERENT UNVELTS ANENAS AND SO ARE HUMAN UNVELTS
497_françois_chollet|IT'S THE EVICE OF VERSA
497_grant_sanderson|LIKE THE IDEA STARTS OF THE RESEARCH AND THE IN THEIR SCRIPTING
497_jitendra_malik|AND THE HOARSE MOVES
497_joscha_bach|THE FACT THAT I EXISTED
497_kate_darling|SO KATE
497_manolis_kellis|SOME GENES EVOLVE SUPERSPERFAST
497_matt_botvinick|UNITS THAT CONNECT TO OTHER UNITS THAT CONNECT TO OTHER UNITS SO YOU HAVE SORT OF LOOPS OF CONACTIVITY
497_russ_tedrake|AND WHERE WOULD WE BE TO DAY I DON'T I DON'T THINK WE'D BE AS FAR AS WE AS WE ARE THERE'S SOMETHING TO BE SAID ABOUT HAVING THE SIMPLEST EXPLANATION
498_françois_chollet|THOUGH I WISHIN I'LL TELL YOU YOU KNOW
498_ian_hutchinson|AS A TWO WAY
498_joscha_bach|ORSO YOU DON'T KNOW THE STATE AND WICHAU ON'T HAVE HERSELF
498_kate_darling|IT WAS O WONDERFUL TALKING TODAY
498_peter_singer|THAT IF WE DON'T KNOW THE TARMSCALE
498_russ_tedrake|ER A PHENOMENON SO I DON'T
498_steven_pressfield|I HURT MYSHELF CARMA
499_françois_chollet|AND IN TURNS AUT YOU CAN CRET A SYSTEM THAT'S MUCH MORE ADAPTATIVE THAT CAN JOW NIZE MUCH BETTER IF YOU JUST ADD AM
499_ian_hutchinson|IN THIS TEWAY COMMUNICATION
499_joscha_bach|YOU CANT TURN OFF YOURSELF YOU KNOW
499_matt_botvinick|ACTIVELY HOLDING SOMETHING IN MIND
499_russ_tedrake|WE CAN TRAIN NO ON THAT WORKS TO PREDICT EVEN
499_sara_seager|AND IT'S ALMOST LOOKS LIKE PEOPLE ARE EXCITE ABOUT SCIGNSE THEY'RE EXCITED BY DISCOVERY
499_steven_pressfield|AND IN THE WORLD OF THE SELF OF THE GREATER SELF THE DOMINANT EMOTION IS LOVE NOT FEAR
500_david_eagleman|PER CENT OF
500_dileep_george|BECAUSE GLOBELY THATS SOLELY THING THAT MAKES SENSE  SO NOW
500_manolis_kellis|IF YOU LOOK AT THE NEWCLO CAPSID PROTIN THAT'S ALSO TO PROFO A SLOW REVOLVING
500_matt_botvinick|AND AM
500_richard_karp|SUCH THAT ANY VERTIC EACH VERTEX IN THE SED IS ADJACENT
500_russ_tedrake|PHYSICAL AND YOU KNOW A
500_sara_seager|DISCOVERY RIGHT AND THEN THE POSSIBILITY THATHERE'S ALIEN LIFE THA VISITED EARTH
500_sergey_levine|FOR IMPROVING RELIABILITY SAFETY IN THINKS LIKE THAT IS MORE WITH SYSTEMS THAT
501_david_eagleman|POSSIBILITIES OF FAI CONSENTS
501_dileep_george|ILL YOU CAN
501_grant_sanderson|JUST IN THE BACKGROUND AND THEN WHENCE YOU FEEL LIKE YOU HAVE THE UNDERSTANDING FOR ONE YOU PUT IT ON THE LIST OF THINGS THAT
501_jitendra_malik|FOCESSED ON THE TOPDOWN TRAINING SIGNAL
501_matt_botvinick|END A A AND SO THAT MEMORY GIVES THE RECURRENT NRL NATWORKA
501_peter_singer|FROM EUCLAR WEAPONS FOR BILOGICAL WEAPONS FROM
501_richard_karp|TWO EACH OF THE OTHERS
501_russ_tedrake|EFICALS EM A TYPOCUATIONS
502_david_eagleman|AND SO I'M VERY YOU KNOW I MEAN SO YOU KNW I'VE GIVEN UP MY LAB AND I I RUN THIS COMPANY DINTY PERCENT OF MY TIME NOW I
502_joscha_bach|A REAL THING IT'S A CONSTRACT IS AN IDEA
502_manolis_kellis|THIS IS THE PART OF THE SPIKE PROTENT THAT ACTUALLY TOUCHES THE ACE TO RECEPTRE AS IT ENABLES THE
502_peter_singer|AN THAT SERF GLUBL WARMING FALLS INTO THAT CATEGORY
502_richard_karp|SOA CLEAK IS SIR
502_sheldon_solomon|UP BY EMBRACING
503_ben_goertzel|JOHN CLEARY
503_joscha_bach|AND YOU CAN CHANGE THAT IDEA
503_manolis_kellis|VIROUS TO ATTACH
503_richard_karp|I DETERMINE
503_sergey_levine|BUT I THINK THAT THE
503_steven_pressfield|NO DIFFERENCE BETWEEN YOU AND ME
504_dileep_george|OING A MORE TASTE IN FRANCE
504_ian_hutchinson|ENTITIES IN THE CREATED WORLD AND THE MOST FUNDAMENTAL THING
504_jitendra_malik|MAKE MY ARY SUCH AGENDER INRAFA FOOTFO
504_matt_botvinick|IS INHERENT TO THE CONNECTIVITY OF THE RECURRENAL NATR
504_richard_karp|WHETHER IN A GIVEN GRAFT THERE EXISTS A CLEAQU
504_sara_seager|I WANT WOULD HE MAKE WHAT HE MAKE OF THAT
504_sheldon_solomon|URCUGARD SAYS THEY THEN TRANQUILLIZE THEMSELVES WITH THE TRIVIAL
505_ben_goertzel|MACHINE LEARNING TO GET TO THE PREDECESSOR FOR TENSOR FLOW IN TORCHE AND AND ALL THESE THINGS ALSO SHANE LEG
505_david_eagleman|OR ENDLESS EXACTLY SO IF YOU ASK WHAT I THINK ABOUT NURL LINK
505_dileep_george|IT IS BECAUSE YOU YOU HAVE SHOWN IT A LOT OF THIS COMPINITIENCE DUING TRAINING TIME
505_jitendra_malik|OCATS O LINT THAT MAY BE TAKEN A STEP INTO O SAGMENTATIONS THATICCENE UNDERSTANDING
505_kate_darling|LET ME LEAVE YOU WITH SOME TWEETS
505_matt_botvinick|SO THAT'S THAT'S IDEA NUMBER ONE NOW
505_richard_karp|F A CERTAIN SIZE
505_sheldon_solomon|AND
506_grant_sanderson|CRIPTING IS HEET THAT'S THE WORST
506_ian_hutchinson|ABRAHAM AND MOSES AND SO FORTH HANDED IT DOWN
506_sara_seager|A ORDIODI RELEASED FOOTAGE
506_steven_pressfield|IN MY OPINION
507_ben_goertzel|FROM HIM TO HIS STUDENTS TO THEIR STUDENTS YOU CAN GO
507_david_eagleman|THAT HAD AN IMPACT ON YOU WHEN YOU WERE YOUNGER OR TO DAY AND A
507_françois_chollet|AS TO QUESTION OR HUMAN LIFE
507_jitendra_malik|THE MOVEMENT OF OBJECTS SO  FOR PEOPLE WHO DON'T KNOW COMPETE A VISION
507_manolis_kellis|SO BASKLY ANYTHING IN IN GENERAL INEVOLUTION IF YOU LOOK AT GENUMS ANYTHING THAT'S CONTACTING THE ENVIRONMENT
507_matt_botvinick|BY THE SCYNAPTIC WEIGHTS
507_richard_karp|BUT HOW BUT IF SOMEBODY HANDS YOU A CLEAK
507_russ_tedrake|O ACHIEVING THIS
507_sheldon_solomon|BUT E POINTS OUT THAT
507_steven_pressfield|RESISTANCE IS THE VOICE OF THE EGO
508_jitendra_malik|SAGMENTATION IS THIS WEIRD ACTIVITY THAT WE THAT COMPUTER VISION FOLKS OF ALL AGREED IS VERY IMPORTANT AH
508_richard_karp|AND ASK YOU TO CHECK
508_russ_tedrake|ABUT THE REPRESENTATION MATTERS
508_sergey_levine|YOU SAID NEFARIOUS HUMANS GETTING SOME TROUBLE I MEAN MACHIE LEARNING SYSTEMS OF IN SOME WAYS HAVE REVEALED TO US
508_sheldon_solomon|HE DOESN'T CARE FOR THAT TERM BECAUSE TRANQUILIYES
508_steven_pressfield|AND IT'S A FEARFUL VOICE
509_ben_goertzel|ULTIMATELY LATHER
509_david_eagleman|I GREW UP IN THE MOUNTAINS AND NEW MEXICO AND SO THAT WAS MOSTLY WI I SPENT MY TIME WAS READING BOOKS BUT AM
509_grant_sanderson|AH THAT MAKES IT HAPPEN AND THEN WHEN I HIT WRITER'S BLOCK LIKE THE SOLUTION TO WRITER'S BLOCK IS TO READ
509_matt_botvinick|REINFORCEMENT LEARNING ALGRYTHM THAT YOU'RE YOU KNOW TRAINING THE NETWORK WITH
509_sara_seager|PEOPLE CONTACT US ME THERE'S A LOT OF THEM ABOUT HEY I HAVE SUFFED YOU SHOULD SEE
509_sergey_levine|THE ETHICAL FLAWS IN OUR DATA
510_françois_chollet|CODTY BILL AND INTELLS YOUR SYSTEM
510_grant_sanderson|DOESN'T EVEN HAVE TO BE RELATED JUST READ SOMETHING DIFFERENT I JUST FER LIKE
510_ian_hutchinson|IT'S NOT IT WETS NOT ABOUT TELLING US YOU KNOW HOW GOD CREATED THE WORLD IT'S ABOUT TELLING ARSON TELLING THE EAR THE HEBREWS
510_jitendra_malik|ABOLNY BOX OR AN N CLASSIFYING THAT OBJECT A
510_matt_botvinick|SO THE PUNCH LINE IS IF YOU TRAIN A RECURRENT NORAL NETWORK WITH A REINFORCEMENT LEARNING ALGARYTHM THAT'S ADJUSTING ITS WEIGHTS AND YOU DO THAT FOR LONG ENOUGH
510_richard_karp|M YOU COULD DO THAT SIMPLY BY EXHAUSTIVELY LOOKING AT ALL THE EDGES BETWEEN THE VERTICES IN THE CLEAQU
510_russ_tedrake|AN SIMPLE DOESN'T MEAN LOW TO MENTION ALL THAT'S ONE THING I THINK WE'VE A LESSON THAT WE'VE LEARNED SO WELL YOU NOW A STANDARD WAY TO DO
510_sergey_levine|IN THAT SAME KIND OF WAY CAN REFORCE A LEARNING TEACH US ABOUT OURSELVES
511_ben_goertzel|TRYING TO PULL TOGETHER AN AGII COMMUNITY
511_dileep_george|THAT YOU ARE TRYING TO EXPLAIN THE PICTOLS
511_françois_chollet|A THE COUPLE PROBLEM HAW HEART IS THIS PROBLEM ON WHICH INTELLIGENC TAS THIS PROEM ACTUALLY REQUIRES
511_jitendra_malik|WHAT'S WHAT'S THE VALUE OF SEGMENTATION WHAT IS IT
511_russ_tedrake|MODEL REDUCTION OR SYSTEM IDENTIFICATION IN CONTROLS AS TO THE TYPICAL FORMULATION IS THAT YOU TRY TO FIND THE MINIMAL STATE
511_sergey_levine|AS IT TAUGHT SOMETHING
512_ian_hutchinson|WHO GOD IS
512_joscha_bach|CAT EXES TO YOUR OWN SORESCORT HOPEFULLY NOT BEFORE YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU ARE DOING AND THEN YOU CAN CHANGE THE WAY AT WORKS TEMPORARILY OR PERMANENTLY O
512_peter_singer|AT'S NOT CLEAR TO ME
512_russ_tedrake|DIMENSION REALIZATION OF A SYSTEM THAT HITS SOME AIR BOUNDS OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
512_sergey_levine|WHAT HAVE YOU LEARNED ABOUT YOURSELF FROM TRYING TO BUILD ROBOTS ANRID FORESOME LEARNING SYSTEMS
513_ben_goertzel|EARL OTS WOLS LIVING I N WASHKIN DECI AND MAKING A LIVING DOING
513_david_eagleman|ALL THE LIGHT WE CANNOT SEE
513_françois_chollet|BEFORE WE EVER LEARN KOROKO TO DRIVE  GET TO WATCH OTHER
513_manolis_kellis|ES PROB INTELLIGENT
513_matt_botvinick|GOOD JOB HERE'S A NEW BOX AND EVERY BOX HAS ITS OWN PROBABILITIES NE HAVE TO VIGOR
513_sara_seager|YOU KNOW THESE ARE GOING TO BE VERY DIFFICULT TO STUDY SCIENTIFIC PHENOMENA
514_david_eagleman|THAN DOWN YE
514_dileep_george|ARE THE THINGS THAT COST A PICTOLS
514_françois_chollet|TO GET IN A LOT OF DATA
514_ian_hutchinson|OU KNOW IF IF WE WERE JUST
514_joscha_bach|THE RESULTS THAT ARE HAPPENING AND SO MOST PEOPLE ARE NOT ZEP OF EBUCUS TERE
514_sheldon_solomon|IN THE FOLLOWING WAY THING NUMBER ONE
515_ben_goertzel|AND I ORGANIZED THE FIRST
515_david_eagleman|SO WERE I NEECS YE MENTIONED HEMMINGWAY
515_françois_chollet|THAT THO THE QUESTION IS
515_grant_sanderson|ITH THE MAGICAL THING THAT MAKES THIS WHOLE STORY LIKE TISAS WHOLE STORY TOGETHER
515_matt_botvinick|THE WHAT WHAT HAPPENS IT SEEMED ALMOST MAGICAL TO TO US WHEN WE FIRST STARTED
515_richard_karp|VERTECES
516_dileep_george|IN THIS PARTICLARCASE THE TEMPERAL ASPIC IS NOT IMPORTANT I IS MORT LIKE WHEN
516_joscha_bach|TOO AM
516_matt_botvinick|REALIZING WHAT WAS GOING ON THE SLOW LEARNING OUTRYTHM AJUSTING THE THE SCYNAPTIC WEIGHTS
516_peter_singer|AM NOT CONVINCED
516_russ_tedrake|THAT A RUB OUT OUR HAND IS PICKING UP AN OBJECT OR SOMETHING
516_steven_pressfield|HUM I CAN TALK MORE ABOUT IS IF WO WANT NO FOR SURE THAT  THAT'S A THAT'S FASTENING IS JUST IT'S INTERESTING WHY THE
517_grant_sanderson|I DID NAT CALL FOR QUESTIONS OF PEOPLE WHEND ASK YOU QUESTIONS AND SO MANY REQUESTS FROM PEOPLE ABOUT LIKE CERTAIN VIDIOS THET WOULD LOVE YOU TO DO ISS SUCH A PILE
517_jitendra_malik|THEN WHEN THERE THERE'S THE MOTHER SAYS
517_matt_botvinick|THOUGH THOSE SLOW SCYNAPTIC CHANGES GIVE RISE TO A NETWORK DYNAMICS
517_richard_karp|SO FINDING MC LEAK IS HARD CHECKING IT IS EASY
517_russ_tedrake|AND WHEN I WRITE DOWN THE EQUATIONS OF MOTION FOR THAT THEY RE THEY LOOK
517_steven_pressfield|FEARS ATTACHED THE EGO I REALLY LIKE THIS DICOTOMY OF EGO IMSELF AND THAT STRUGGLE
518_dileep_george|AH EVEN THE LOCALLY IT WILL LOOK LIKE OKE THIS IS AN A
518_ian_hutchinson|THAT HE'S REVEALED HIMSELF SUPREMELY
518_joscha_bach|AND THE TYPES OF MODES THAT WE FORM RITE NOW ARE NOT SPARS ENOUGH
518_manolis_kellis|AND HOW IS THAT HAPPENING BY
518_peter_singer|NNIC BOSTROMIN NA
518_richard_karp|PROBLEMS OF THAT NATURE
519_david_eagleman|A OR WOULD HE MEAN
519_jitendra_malik|AH THE CATS BEHAVING FUNNY TO DAY
519_manolis_kellis|ACROSS THOUSANDS OFF
519_matt_botvinick|TURN INTO A LEARNING OUTREN
519_russ_tedrake|ACTUALLY NOT SO MUCH BECAUSE OF THEE
519_sergey_levine|THE ACQUISITION OF EXPERIENCE IN THE REAL WORLD
519_steven_pressfield|EGO HAS TE
520_dileep_george|IT LOOKS LIKE AN A BUT WHEN I LOOK AT IT
520_françois_chollet|RIGHT AND THAT IS NOVEL COMPLEXITYIS NOT JUST A AM
520_grant_sanderson|VERY OFTEN REALLY GOOD IDEAS AND IT'S LIKE
520_ian_hutchinson|AM AND SO YOU KNOW WHEN JESUS
520_matt_botvinick|SO IN OTHERWORDS YOU CAN YOU CAN TELL THIS IS HAPPENING BY JUST FREEZING THE SENAPTIC WATE SAYING OKE NO MORE LEARNING YOU'RE DONE
520_peter_singer|CAUSE YOU SAY WHAT IS UTILITARIANISM
520_russ_tedrake|DYNAMICS OF THE HAND WHEN IT'S MOVING BUT IT'S JUST THE INNER ACTIONS
520_sara_seager|IT'TRUE WE DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW
520_sheldon_solomon|WITH THE THE DEATH PART
520_steven_pressfield|OU DONTTHE SELF OBSESSION OF IT WHY
521_françois_chollet|INTERPARATION  OVER THE SITUATIONS THAT YOU'VE ENCOUNTERED PREVIOUSLY LIKE LEARNING TO DRIVE IN THE WS
521_grant_sanderson|AT SUCH A
521_manolis_kellis|A VICES WOULD BE MORE INTELLIGENT BECAUSE THERE'S JUST MORE OF THEM
521_matt_botvinick|HERE'S A NEW BOX
521_peter_singer|YOUTELTARANISM IS THE ETICAL VIEW THAT THE RIGHT THING TO DO
521_russ_tedrake|AND WHEN THEY TURN ON AND OFF
521_sergey_levine|AUTIMATED GENERAL METHODS
521_sheldon_solomon|AND NOW HE SAYS
521_steven_pressfield|LEL'S THINK ABOUT THE WHOLE THING IN TERMS OF STORIES
522_joscha_bach|
522_peter_singer|IS THE ACT
522_russ_tedrake|WRIGHT SO HAVING A HIGH DIMENSIONAL INO BUT SIMPLE DESCRIPTION OF WHAT'S HAPPENING OUT HERE IS FINE BUT IF WHEN I ACTUALLY START TOUCHING
522_sara_seager|NOT LIKE A SKETCHY PICTURE OF SOMETHING
522_steven_pressfield|IS ALWAYS RESISTANCE
523_françois_chollet|AH A
523_grant_sanderson|DON'T LET YOURSELF LAMENT THE ONES THAT STAY CLOSED
523_manolis_kellis|WE WOULD NOT BE HERE IF HE WASN'T FOR VIRS
523_matt_botvinick|AND THE RECURTAIN OR THAT WORK WILL DO THIS JUST FINE THERE'S NO THAGT IT IT FIGURES OUT WHICH WHICH BUTTON IS BEST IT TRANSIT KIND OF
523_russ_tedrake|I WRITE DOWN A DIFFERENT DYAMICAL SYSTEM FOR EVERY
523_steven_pressfield|IS ALWAYS THE EGO THE HERO
524_françois_chollet|ANYE AND YOU REAL AMONT OF INTELLIGENCE FOR INSTANCE IF YOU REAL DID HATE INFINITE TRAIN DERE
524_ian_hutchinson|MAKES HIMSELF SEEN IN LESS OBVIOUS WAYS IN OURAL WORLD TO DAY ABSOLUTELY
524_joscha_bach|A SIMILAR TO A GENERATIVE ADVERSARIAL NETWORK LEARNED CERTAIN CONSTRAINTS
524_peter_singer|WHAT THAT MEANS IS
524_richard_karp|AND CERTAINLY VERIFY
524_sheldon_solomon|AS I WAS SAYING EARLIER YEUR
525_dileep_george|AM SOT IS NOT JUST DOING A CLASSIFICATION RIGHT IT IS IT IS IT IS
525_françois_chollet|AM YOU COULD JUST LES RETRAIN AND ENTO AN DIPTINI MULRID THE STRIVING
525_ian_hutchinson|ABSOLUTELY I MEAN IT AY IT CERTAINLY BEEN
525_manolis_kellis|AND CREATED
525_sheldon_solomon|AR NOT
526_ben_goertzel|TO DAY I MEAN NOW
526_david_eagleman|IS THERE IS THERE A WHY HERE WHAT'S THE MEANING OF LIFE
526_dileep_george|IT IS PROVIDING A FULL EXPLANATION FOR THE SCENE SO WEN WEN IT WEN IT
526_françois_chollet|PROVIDED INFINITE TRANGETA THE ONLY PROBLEM A WIT THE WHOLE IDEA
526_grant_sanderson|VERY LIKELY WOULD GET MORE DONE IF I WAS ATEMATIC IN THAT WAY
526_matt_botvinick|HAVE BEEN SHAPED BY THIS SLOW LEARNING PROCESS THAT'S OCCURRED OVER MANY MANY BOXES
526_sheldon_solomon|HYDEGER
526_steven_pressfield|JUST LIKE
527_david_eagleman|NOW DAVID
527_jitendra_malik|LACES WHERE THERE MIGHT BE A  BLEEDS FOR EXAMPLE
527_joscha_bach|MAYBE THE HAVE FLYING DREAMS AS CHILDREN
527_peter_singer|ODDS THAT YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO PRODUCE THOSE CONSEQUENCES THAT SOMETHING WILL GO WRONG
527_sergey_levine|MAY BE STEPPING BACK THROUGH YOUR LIFE
527_steven_pressfield|THE EGO JUST LIKE RESISTANCE AND
528_ben_goertzel|NOT NOW IT'S MORE LIKE THIS IS THE MAIN GATHERING
528_david_eagleman|LIEFOARD POIN OF VIEW BY WHICH I MEAN
528_dileep_george|THIS IS THE PARD IS THE AIR AND THESE ARE THE PICTULS THAT TURNED ON
528_françois_chollet|AH AH WITH THIS PLAN WITH THIS IDEA IT'S JUST THAT
528_grant_sanderson|LIKE IT'S VERY FUNTILIKE WRITE A SCHEDULE AND MAKE A BLOG POST ABOUT LIKE THE P PRODUCTIVE DAY
528_ian_hutchinson|THAT GOD IS SEEN IN THE CREATION THAT WE WHEN WE LOOK AT THE CREATION
528_jitendra_malik|AND ANDES THERE ARE
528_manolis_kellis|AT BASILY CONTROLLD AUR GENES
528_matt_botvinick|HANGING  THE DYNAMICS OF THE NET WERE THE ACTIVITY DANAMIC
528_peter_singer|SIMPLE CASE LETS ASSUME WE WE HAVE CERTAINTY ABOUT WHAT THE CONSEQUENCE OIR ACTIONS WILL BE THEN THE RIGHT ACTION IS THE ACTION THAT WILL PRODUCE
528_richard_karp|ALTHOUGH THEY MAY BE HARD TO SOLVE
528_russ_tedrake|MORINTUTIVE PHYSICS
528_sergey_levine|WOOD BOOK OR BOOKS
528_steven_pressfield|MAYBE ALIEN IS A BAD EXAMPLE BECAUSE SEGUANI WIVER HAST A SORT OF
529_ben_goertzel|A FEEBLY ONE WO ACHIEVE A G A
529_david_eagleman|YOERL WAS ASKING
529_françois_chollet|AH IT STRIKES ME AS A VERY INEFFICENT THING TO DO BECAUSE YORAN
529_grant_sanderson|AM THEY LIKE MIGHT WORK FOR ONE PERSON BUT I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH PEOPLE GET OUT OF LIKE READING THEM OR TRYING TO ADOPT SOME ONE ELSE'S STYLE
529_ian_hutchinson|WE SEE TO SOME EXTENT THE WONDER THE MAJESTY THE MIGHT
529_manolis_kellis|THE COMPLEX OF THE CURGUITRY OF MAMILLIONGINUS
529_matt_botvinick|INTO ITS OWN LEARNING OU
529_peter_singer|THE BEST CONSEQUENCES
529_richard_karp|YOU CAN
529_sergey_levine|TECHNICAL OR FICTION OR PHILOSOPHICAL
529_steven_pressfield|A FIGHT ON THE SAME TERMS AS AS THE ALIEN BUT MAYBE A BETTER EXAMPLE MIGHT BE SOMETHING LIKE CASABLANCA
530_david_eagleman|ME THAT'S THE ACT OF ASKING WHAT THE HEKE IS THIS THING FOR
530_françois_chollet|AND TO DESA DESAL
530_ian_hutchinson|OF THE PERSON OR
530_joscha_bach|ESSENTIALLY
530_richard_karp|IS GOING TO BE HARDER THAN
530_sergey_levine|HAD A BIG IMPACT ON
530_sheldon_solomon|THE OFFSPRING OF WORKING CLASS PEOPLE AND HYDEGER WHAT HE SAYS IS
531_françois_chollet|WOULD BE A TEST THAT LOOKS AT SKILL ACQUISITION OF HER UNKNOWN TASKS
531_manolis_kellis|HANDS AND WERE WORKING TOGETHER NOT ON THET BUT AND YET YOU SWIP THER WHILE TO THEM
531_peter_singer|NEED TO ADD AND THAT IS
531_richard_karp|THAT IS GOING TO INCLUDE
531_russ_tedrake|FIRST OF ALL I MEAN
532_dileep_george|THAT IS USEFUL AND INTERPRETABLE
532_françois_chollet|I WOULD SEE TO ME DRIVING IS
532_jitendra_malik|TAKES ON A VISUAL SCENE
532_manolis_kellis|YOU KNOW I NEVER SAID THEY'RE DUMB
532_matt_botvinick|IT STARTED KIND OF RINGING A BELL FOR US WHICH IS TO SAY THAT
532_peter_singer|UTILITARIANS
532_russ_tedrake|IMPORTANT HISTORY FORMITY I THINK AS THE BEING A PART OF THE DARPA RUBATIX CHALLENGE CAN YOU MAY BE
532_sergey_levine|IT COULD BE VERY MUCH BIGGER
533_ben_goertzel|YOU COULDN'T REALLY
533_dileep_george|ARM AND A
533_françois_chollet|A BLACK BOX
533_ian_hutchinson|I HAVE
533_jitendra_malik|AND BREAKS IT APART INTO
533_sara_seager|AND IS SO GREAT IN ONE TIME
533_sergey_levine|IOOF THIS IS LIKE A
533_steven_pressfield|PUTS HER ON THE PLAIN TO LISBON
534_david_eagleman|TO US A YOUNG PERSON TO DAY
534_ian_hutchinson|OVER OVER THE AGES AND A CERTAINLY
534_jitendra_malik|INTO INTERESTING ENTITIES YE THAT MIGHT BE USEFUL FOR WHATEVER THE TASK IS YE
534_manolis_kellis|THEY DON'T CARE ANOTHER THING ALL IS THE VIRES TRYING TO KILL INOW IT'S NOT
534_matt_botvinick|SCYNAPTIC LEARNING
534_peter_singer|HAPPINESS IN THE ABSENCE OF PAIN AND SUFFERING AND THERE ARE OTHER CONSEQUENTIALISTS
534_russ_tedrake|TELL YOUR STORY
534_sergey_levine|A SCIENTIFICL LY
534_sheldon_solomon|AND
535_david_eagleman|INTHE CRAZY CHAOS THAT WE LIVE TO DAY A ABOUT LIFE ABOUT HOW TO
535_grant_sanderson|THE ONETTE LAKE
535_manolis_kellis|THE VIRIT IS NOT TRYING TO KILL YO IT'S STRUCK IT'S NOT ITS ACTUALLY ACTIVELY TRYING TO NOT KILL YO
535_sara_seager|AND I SAID SURE AND THEY WERE LIKE VI NICEST PEOPLE
535_sergey_levine|LIKE PARTICULARLY MEANINGFUL ANSWER BUT
536_jitendra_malik|ITIN WAS PERCEPTION AND COGNITION
536_joscha_bach|AND NOT FALL
536_peter_singer|AH THERE ARE DIFFERENT THINGS THAT COULD BE GOOD CONSEQUENCES
536_sara_seager|AND JUST ONE OF MANY WHO HAS AN ALIEN ALIEN ABDUCTION STORY
536_sheldon_solomon|GOOD CHOICES
537_ben_goertzel|IMMEDIATELY PRACTICAL THEN YOU KNOW IN THE BAR AFTER THE SUMON ARE YOU COULD BULST IT ABOUT AH I
537_dileep_george|ARE VERY SIMILAR TO THE KINDS OF ERRORS HUMANS WOULD MAKE
537_grant_sanderson|A DICTION IT'S  IT'S A DOPAMENDICTION
537_peter_singer|JUSTICE FREEDOM
537_russ_tedrake|GRAND CHALLENGE AND DARP URBAN CHALLENGE WHICH WERE THE CHALLENGES THAT BROUGHT US A
537_sara_seager|AND THE WOMAN A
537_sheldon_solomon|SO NOW YOU ARE YOURE GUILTY
537_steven_pressfield|IS THE EAGLE IS RESISTANCE IS FEAR IS THAT ZERO SOME THING AND IN ALMOST EVERY STORY THE HERO
538_david_eagleman|IS IT IS THERE SOME WORDS THAT YOU COULD GIVE
538_dileep_george|OF THE ASSUMPTIONS AS THE MENTIONED ARE
538_grant_sanderson|I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S A PROBLEM BECAUSE AS LONG AS IT'S A KIND OF SOCIALIZING LIKE IF YOU'RE ACTUALLY ENGAGING WITH FRIENDS AND ENGAGING WITH OTHER PEOPLE'S IDEAS
538_jitendra_malik|BECAUSE WE DO DEVISE OUR NOTION OF
538_joscha_bach|THINGS A COMPELLING NOTION
538_richard_karp|PROBLEM WHERE A SOLUTION CAN BE RAPIDLY CHECKED
538_russ_tedrake|UT A SPOT LIGHT ONSELF DRIVING
538_steven_pressfield|IS SOME ONE THAT IS WILLING TO MAKE A SACRIFICE
539_ben_goertzel|NOW AGIES NOT ONLY IN THE ACADEMIC SUMIN OUR ROOM LIKE YOU HAVE
539_grant_sanderson|I THINK IT CAN BE REALLY USEFUL
539_joscha_bach|BUT IT DISCARDS QUIETLY
539_sara_seager|AND SHE HAD APPARENTLY SOMETHING IMPLANTED BEHIND HER EAR WHICH WAS SOMEHOW UNIMPLANTED LATER AND THY WERE JUST SO SINCERE
539_sergey_levine|WILL FIRST OF ALL
539_sheldon_solomon|AND THEN HE USES THA THE POET  RELCA A
540_dileep_george|THESE ARE ALL GENERALLY APPLICABLE OTHEMALTS IN ONOUR VISION SO WHY WHY W
540_françois_chollet|DEAL WITH NEW SITUATIONS
540_manolis_kellis|I I LIKE YOU HAVE TO CLEAN YOURSELF OF ANY KIND OF ANTHROPOMORPHISM OUT THERE
540_peter_singer|MANAGEABLE AND A
540_russ_tedrake|IL PRAT WAS AT DARPA
540_sara_seager|AND THE'RE'S SUCH A LOVELY COUPLE
540_sergey_levine|A ARTIFICIAL
540_sheldon_solomon|HE HAS A PHRASE BACKER USES IT IN THE DENIAL OF DEATH THE GUILT OF UNLIVED LIFE
541_dileep_george|AN THO SPENT MONKS ARE USEFUL POOR DEPLANNING KIND OF ALGYDOM SFARE
541_françois_chollet|OR I MEAN
541_grant_sanderson|IT'S IS DEFTLY IN EDICTION
541_joscha_bach|S UNDERLYING IT SOMEHOW
541_peter_singer|PHILOSOPHICAL SENSE IT STILL IN PRACTICE
541_richard_karp|IT'S B WHILE WE EXPECT THAT IF SOMEBODY HANDS YOU A
541_russ_tedrake|PITCHED A NEW CHALLENGE THAT INVOLVED DISASTER RESPONSE
541_sara_seager|THEY JUST WANTED TO SHARE THEIR STORY THAT'STHAT'S THE REAL
541_sergey_levine|MIGT  ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AS TOME ARTIFICIAL RABOTIC SYSTEMS HAVE A YOU KNOW KIND OF A BIG PLACE A BIG ROLL IN SOCIETY
542_ben_goertzel|SOMETHING WHICH IS THE PURSUIT OF LIKE CRAZED MAVARICS CRACKPOTS AN AND SIGNED STRICTEN FANATICS
542_dileep_george|YU INA SUDE THE SETTINGS
542_jitendra_malik|THEY CAN MORE INDEPENDENTLY
542_manolis_kellis|THERE JUST A LITTLE ANTITY
542_richard_karp|SATISFYING SCHEDULE YOU CAN VERIFY THAT IT WORKS
542_russ_tedrake|IT DIDN'T EXPLICITLY REQUIRE HUMANIDES ALTHOUGH HUMANIDES CAME INTO THE PICTURE
542_sara_seager|WHATEVER THAT IS THAT'S THE REAL THING
542_steven_pressfield|LIKE WHAT WOULD
543_ben_goertzel|OU KNOW A MARKETING TERM FOR LARGE LARGE COROPORATIONS AN THE NATIONAL LEADER WHICH IT IS A
543_grant_sanderson|IF I LOOK AT A DAY
543_joscha_bach|OF THE KIND WE HAVE NEVER BEEN ABLE TO CONSTRUCT
543_manolis_kellis|WHICH HAPPENS TO BE DIVIDING AND SPREADING
543_matt_botvinick|WE KNOW THAT IT'S AN IMPORTANT LOCUS FOR
543_peter_singer|AS A ROUGH GUIDE
543_sara_seager|THE MYSTERY OF THE HUMAN MIND RIGHT IS MORE POWERFUL THAN ANY
543_sergey_levine|SORT OF THE THE LIMITING CASE OF TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCEMENT OF HOW THAT MIGHT PLAY OUT IN IN OUR FUTURE HISTORY
543_steven_pressfield|LIFE LOOK LIKE WITHOUT RESISTANCE
544_ben_goertzel|ASTOUNDING TRANSITION BUT YET
544_grant_sanderson|OR F CHECKSSHEMEDIA LOT
544_ian_hutchinson|THAT SCIENCE IS ALL THE REAL KNOWLEDGE THERE IS
544_peter_singer|TWO DIFFERENT ACTIONS AND ONE WHARE WE HAVE TO FOCUS ON THE SHORT TERM
544_russ_tedrake|AND OUR CHALLENGE WAS MOTIVATED ROUGHLY BY THAT BECAUSE THAT WAS A CASE WHERE W
544_steven_pressfield|ATSOR GETS ANOTHER GREAT QUESTION I THINK I ALSO BELIEVE THAT
545_ben_goertzel|IN THE COURSE OF THIS TRANSITION
545_dileep_george|AND HERE IS MY TESTET SO THATHE THE TRAINING THAT IS ALMOST
545_joscha_bach|WHICIS LIKE ITS HUMBLING AT LEAST IN MY IMAGINATION THE AMOUNT OF INFORMATION REQUIRED TO ACT IN THIS WORLD
545_matt_botvinick|SO MAYBE THE PREFRONTAL QUARTEX SUPPORTS REINFORCEMENT LEARNING IN OTHER WORDS
545_peter_singer|CONSEQUENCES BECAUSE WE JUST CAN'T REALLY PREDICT
545_richard_karp|SO KIN NOT WE
545_sara_seager|MAYBE A GETTING A SENSE OF NUMBERS
545_sheldon_solomon|BY VIRTUE OF CHOICES THAT YOU'VE MADE OR JUST AS OFTEN HAVE DECLINED TO MAKE
546_dileep_george|AH IN A HUNDRED EIXHT THOUSAND EXBIGER THAN
546_jitendra_malik|YOU DESCRIBE THESE THREE AURS SHOW HOW THEY INTERACT YES O A
546_joscha_bach|I THINK SAYING THAT YOU'LL NOT WAS CAN ACCOMPLISH IT IS MISSING
546_manolis_kellis|ONIQUIRES IMUTATION THAT ENTERS FASTER
546_peter_singer|ALL OF THE LONG RETERM RAMIFICATIONS
546_russ_tedrake|AVERTED DISASTER AND CERTAINLY AFTER
546_sergey_levine|IY RECOMMENDED I MEAN IF NOTHING ELSE YOU'D BE WELL ENTERTAINED WHEN DID YOU FIRST YOURSELF LIKE FALL IN LOVE WITH IDEA OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
546_steven_pressfield|IT' SOO TO BE YOU KNOW WHAT WOULD WE BE WE'D BE IN THE GARDEN OF ETEN PICKING
547_ben_goertzel|I'S CERTAINLY ONE OF THEM IN IT HASN'T GROWN
547_dileep_george|AH THE TEST SAID IN MANY MANY CASES OR WHAT WE WANTED TO DO US IN WURD THAT
547_ian_hutchinson|WE WE HAVE GROWN SO RELIANT ON
547_jitendra_malik|THE RECOGNITION IS THE EASIEST ONE BECAUSE THAT'S A WHAT
547_joscha_bach|IS MISSING THE FACT THAT WE DON'T
547_sergey_levine|ET CAPTIVATED BY THIS FIELD
548_grant_sanderson|AFTER I'VE DONE THAT CHECK WHEN I CHECK IT ONCE A DAY I VERY LIKE I'M HAPPY
548_joscha_bach|YET WE DON'T HAVE YET A MECHANISM FOR CONSTRUCTING SOMETHING LIKE COMMON SENSE REASONING
548_matt_botvinick|MAYBE THE PREFRONTOL QUARTEXAS DOING THAT SORT OF THING STRICTLY IN ITS ACTIVATION PATTERNS IT'S KEEPING AROUND O MEMORY
548_richard_karp|OR DO YOU THINK P
548_russ_tedrake|SO IN PRACTICE WHAT WE ENDERED UP WITH WAS A
548_sergey_levine|SO MY HONEST ANSWER HERE IS ACTUALLY THAT  I ONLY REALLY STARTED TO THINK THINK ABOUT IT AS A
548_steven_pressfield|ACQUIRE KNOWLEDGE THAT UNTIL THEN GOD HAD SAID I'M THE ONLY ONE THAT SCUFFED THAT KNOWLEDGE
549_ben_goertzel|OUKNOW SOMETIMES A
549_ian_hutchinson|THAT THERE ARE MANY WAYS OF GETTING TO NO THINGS IN OUR WORLD
549_joscha_bach|WIT YOUR SENSE
549_matt_botvinick|IN ITS ACTIVITY PATTERNS OF
549_peter_singer|STEAT OF UTILITARIANISM IS FOCUSED ON THE OVERALL AGGREGATE
549_richard_karp|IS NOT EQUAL TO ENP
549_russ_tedrake|A GRAND CHALLENGE A DERPERUBADIX CHALLENGE A WHERE
549_sergey_levine|AS SOMETHING THATI MIGHT WANT TO DO ACTUALLY IN GRADUATE SCHOOL PRETTY LATE
550_ben_goertzel|YOU'RE NOT GOING TO TALK TO THE LEADERS OF THEF OF THE FIELD THERE IF YOU'RE AN OUTSIDER
550_dileep_george|THE THE BEST SET
550_grant_sanderson|IS LIKE WHEN I CHECKED IM ONCE A DAY I'M ABLE TO JEST LIKE
550_matt_botvinick|WHAT YOU DID HOW MUCH REWARD YOU GOT  AND IT'S USING THAT THAT
550_russ_tedrake|BOSTON DYNAMICS WAS A WAS TO MAKE HUMAN ROID ROBUTS
550_sheldon_solomon|AND I LIVE IN AMERICA
551_david_eagleman|O PORT ON ETRON
551_grant_sanderson|LIKE MORE THAN THAT IT IS STARTS EATING AT ME
551_ian_hutchinson|OF SKILLS
551_manolis_kellis|AH YOU KNOW THE ENTIRETY OF VIRCEIT MAY BE A CROSS DIFFERENT STRAINS OF IRUSES IT SEEMS LIKE A LIVING ORGANISM
551_russ_tedrake|PEOPLE LIKE ME AND THE THE AMAZING TEAM ET AMITI AM
551_sheldon_solomon|IN THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY WELL IF I WAS IN THE THIRD CENTURY LIVING IN A YEAR IN MONGOLIA
551_steven_pressfield|WERE THEY DO HAVE TO DEAL WITH THAT FOR YOUR AND THEY DO HAVE TO DEAL WITH ALL THAT STUFF
552_ben_goertzel|THE MAIN KIND OF GENERIC ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE CANMUTE A CONFERENCE IS TOO BIG
552_david_eagleman|OR CONNECTED ME ON TWITTER ALEX FREEDMAN
552_manolis_kellis|I AM IN AWE OF BIOLIGY
552_matt_botvinick|PROGRAMME THAT'S IMPLEMENTED IN THE RECURRENT DYNAMICS OF THE PREFRONT OF ORTEX
552_richard_karp|AND DA NO
552_russ_tedrake|WERE COMPETING FIRST IN A SIMULATION CHALLENGE
552_steven_pressfield|IS THE HUMAN CODITION THE HUMAN CONDITION AND THE MEANING IN THE PURPOSE COMES
553_david_eagleman|AND NOW LET ME LEAVE YOU SOME WORDS FROM DAVID EAGLEMAN IN HIS BOOK SUME
553_dileep_george|OUT OF TRAINING DISTUNCTION GENERALIZITION IF YOU'RE INTERESTED IN STUDYING THAT OAN PUTTING
553_françois_chollet|THE PROCESS OF PRODUCING OF OTONOMOUSLY PRODECING  OBSTRUCTION
553_ian_hutchinson|AND AVOID
553_peter_singer|AY BE POETIC
553_russ_tedrake|TRY TO BE ONE OF THE ONES THAT WINS THE RIGHT TO WORK ON
553_sergey_levine|WORK ON THIS
553_sheldon_solomon|WHAT HE SUBMITS IS THAT THERE IS SOME ASPECTS OF WHATEVER I AM
554_françois_chollet|THE THE EGINE THAT'S KEPI LE OF CODUSING THESE OBSTRUCTIONS I
554_grant_sanderson|AN ME YOUU YO TO PUT STUFF OUT ON YOU TWO A THING IT'S IMPORTANT
554_ian_hutchinson|A SLIPPING INTO SCIENTISM OH YER ABSOLUTELY
554_jitendra_malik|A O TANCE THAT'S RECOGNITION RECONSTRUCTION
554_manolis_kellis|INTO MAKING HIRTY PROTENSTS FROM A SINGLE ARINA
554_sergey_levine|AND THAT KIND O GOT ME THINKING BECAUSE
554_sheldon_solomon|OU GET TO THE POINT WHERE YOU'RE ABLE TO SAY
555_david_eagleman|IMAGINED FOR A MOMENT THEY WERE NOTHING BUT
555_dileep_george|HOW ALL DID I DO HOW MANY EXAMPLES THAT I NEED YE YE I I LIGANI REMEMBER THAT IT WAS
555_grant_sanderson|TO GIVE A MILLION DIMENTIONS THEIR INTERESTING TO YOU BUT YET ONE ONE OF THE INTERESTING ONES IS THE STUDY OF
555_ian_hutchinson|I MEAN THAT I MEAN THEYRE T  THES ARE TWO SEPARATE THINGS SIRK
555_jitendra_malik|ESAR
555_matt_botvinick|WHICH WE BELIEVE ARE IMEDIATED BY DOPAMINE
555_russ_tedrake|AN ORDER TO COMPETE IN
555_sheldon_solomon|O Q
556_ben_goertzel|SEEING BRAVELY HE MEATION TE SHAINLEG HIS DEEP MINED
556_david_eagleman|THE PRODUCT OF BILLIONS OF YEARS AND MOLECULES COMING TOGETHER AND RATCHING UP
556_jitendra_malik|YOU CAN THINK OF IT AS INWORSE GRAPHICS I MEAN THAT'S ONE RIT
556_peter_singer|AHI THINK THAT CAN BE THE RIGHT ANSWER
556_russ_tedrake|THORD THE FINAL CHALLENGE WHICH WAS A PHYSICAL CHALLENGE
556_sara_seager|THESE BIG PLANETS THAT ARE REALLY CLOSE TO THE STAR
556_sheldon_solomon|I AM A CONTINGENT HISTORICAL AND CULTURAL ARTIFACT
557_david_eagleman|OUGH NATURAL SELECTION
557_grant_sanderson|I LIKE NOW HAVE COMPLETELY STOPPED CHECKING STATISTICS OF ANY KIND
557_ian_hutchinson|AUTOMATICALLY
557_joscha_bach|PESICALLY IT'S SIMILAR TO A GAME ENGINE
557_sheldon_solomon|BUT SO ON
557_steven_pressfield|RIGHT SO
558_dileep_george|THAT AH
558_matt_botvinick|SEVERAL TEMP
558_richard_karp|A IF I GIVE YOU
558_russ_tedrake|OLEN THERE WERE THERE WERE TWO TRACKS THOUGH YOU COULD ENTER AS A HARD WARE TEAM WHERE YOU BROUGHT YOUR OWN ROB OUT
558_sara_seager|AND SOME OF THESE PLANETS MIGRATING INWARDS DUE TO INTERACTION WITH OTHER PLANETS OR WITH THE DISC ITSELF THEY MAY HAVE CLEARED IT OUT
558_sergey_levine|YET THIS MIGHT BE A SPECIAL MOMENT IN THE HISTORY OF THE FIELD
558_sheldon_solomon|YOU KNOW IF I WAS YOU KNOW NOT IF I WAS TRANSPORTED A THOUSAND YEARS IN THE PAST IN ASIA
559_ben_goertzel|I THINK ITS EXTIALY CHANGING UNFORTUNATELY BUT SO FAR THEY HAVE BEEN PUSHING THE IDEA THAT
559_jitendra_malik|ALSO LET'S DO THE AINWORSE OF THIS WE ARE GIVIN AN IMAGE AND WE TRY TO
559_manolis_kellis|GOES IN THROWS IN A SINGLE MESSENGER ARINE
559_richard_karp|TWENTY DIGUT OR THIRTY DIG
559_sara_seager|KICKED OTHER PLANETS OUT OF THE SYSTEM
560_david_eagleman|DESIRES FEARS AND ASPIRATIONS
560_dileep_george|USUALLY THESE THINGS HAVE EMOMANDOM ARE IN A ONE
560_sara_seager|SO THERE'S A LOT OF IDEAS FLOATING AROUND WE'RE NOT ENTIRELY SURE
560_sergey_levine|WHAT ADVICE WOULD YOU GIVE TO MAYBE AN UNDEGRADUAU STUDENT MAYBE EVEN YOUNGER
560_sheldon_solomon|I WOULD STILL HAVE CHOICES THAT I COULD MAKE
561_ben_goertzel|GUGBRAIN HAS A LOT OF AMAZING  AGII ORIENTED  PEOPLE ALSO MIN AN N
561_david_eagleman|UNDERSTANDING THIS
561_dileep_george|ANCE OH
561_grant_sanderson|WOULD LIKE TEXT ME SHE'S LIKE
561_ian_hutchinson|PEOPLE ARE SOMETIMES CALL NEW ATHEUS ALTHOUGH THEY ARE ACTUALLY RATHER OLD
561_joscha_bach|APPROXIMATING THE MEGADI FIDELITY
561_matt_botvinick|A IT SORT OF AN
561_peter_singer|THE WORST EXPERIENCE IS POSSIBLE ON THE BEST EXPERIENCES POSSIBLE
561_sara_seager|AND WHAT ABOUT EARTHLIKE PLANIS IS THAT THAT'S ANOTHER LEVEL OF UNCERTAINTY THAT IS AN LEVEL OF UNCERTAINTY IF WE THINK OF AN EARTHLIKE PLANET
561_steven_pressfield|THE MOST RELENTLESS ARE ONE OF THE MORE RELENTLESS SOURCES OF RESISTANCE TO YOU PERSONALLY
562_ben_goertzel|SO I'D SAFE FROM A
562_dileep_george|SOMETHING GETS ESTABLISHED I THE STANDARD BENCH MARK ME BETTE SAY BETTI SAY OH
562_grant_sanderson|YES FONY THAT YOUR DEAD HAD THIS I THINK WA
562_jitendra_malik|YOU KNOW COLLAR ET CETERA ET CETERA
562_joscha_bach|OF WHAT WE CAN PERCEIVE SO IF WE
562_manolis_kellis|A GIANT OPEN READING FRAME THAT'S A GIANT PROTING THAT GETS TRANSLATED
562_matt_botvinick|CHEEKILY SUGGESTED I THINK IT IS IT MAY HAVE BEEN IN IS IT IS A PIGH DETHEOSIS THAT I WE SHOULD THINK ABOUT
562_richard_karp|A ES AM
562_russ_tedrake|THE PROSPECT OF THIS KIND OF CHALLENGE I MEAN SEEMS
562_sara_seager|BEING AN EARTH AROUND A SUN IN THE SAME ORBIT
562_sheldon_solomon|AN THEN HIDIGER SAYS
562_steven_pressfield|I MEAN IT IT'S ALWAYS THE SAME IT IT'S ABOUT WRITING FOR ME I'M
563_françois_chollet|AND THERE'S A CERTAIN POINT IT'S THE GREYARY OF A A CERTAIN POINT
563_ian_hutchinson|SO WHEN THEY SAY THINGS LIKE
563_joscha_bach|PUT ON AN OCULOUS QUEST
563_sara_seager|AN EARTHLIKE PLANET BEING AN EARTHSIZE PLANET IN AN EARTHLIKE ORBET ABOUT A SUNLIKE STAR
563_sergey_levine|I THINK IS IMPORTANT TO DO
563_steven_pressfield|AND AN EVOLVING WITHIN MY OWN BODY OF WORK YOU KNOW IT NEVER AM
564_dileep_george|OH HOW GRADUO STUDENTS OPRADE AND HOW CATM I CANMIC SYSTEM WORKS THAT A PUCIOUS PEOPLE TO
564_richard_karp|OUT ONCE YOU HAVE FOUND THE FACTORS
564_sara_seager|WERE NOT THERE YET AND WERE NOT ABLE TO DETECT ENOUGH OF THOSE TOO
564_steven_pressfield|GOES AWAY NEVER GETS ANY LESS
565_dileep_george|TRAINS VERY QUICKLY WITH VERY LITTLE THAINING BETTER AND ITS
565_françois_chollet|NO I THAT I GUESS EXACTLY WHAT YOU ARE SAYING IS
565_ian_hutchinson|THEY ARE REALLY
565_manolis_kellis|GET CLEAVED
565_steven_pressfield|AS YOU MOVE TO HOPEFULLY HIGHER LEVEL RESISTANCE GETS A LITTLE MORE NEW ONSTILL MORE SUBTLE TRYING TO FAKE YOU OUT BUT
566_dileep_george|OR IN A QUADRABUS TO
566_grant_sanderson|INTERESTING EXPERIENCE THAT YOU PROBABLY DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT CAS
566_ian_hutchinson|AND AND YOU YOU KNOW IF YOU READ THEIR BOOKS THAT'S WHAT YOU FIND THEY REALLY MEAN IS SCIENCE DOESN'T
566_matt_botvinick|MECHANISM THAT WE WERE STARTING TO LOOK AT AND YOU KNOW OTHER GROUPS STARTED TALKING ABOUT VERY SIMILAR THINGS
566_peter_singer|A MY MI
567_ben_goertzel|PUBLIC IMAGE
567_dileep_george|OUT OF DISTRIBUTION AR PROHIBITIONS ON
567_françois_chollet|HOW EFFICIENTLY YOU'RE ABLE TO GENERALIZE
567_grant_sanderson|COMMENTS AND YOUR VITYA IS A SUPERPOSITIVE AH BUT
567_matt_botvinick|THE KIND OF FLAVOR OF METAL LEARNING THAT WE WERE STUDYING
567_peter_singer|PIGHTFUL EXPERIENCES
567_sara_seager|ON THE TOPIC OF SPECE EXPIRATION
567_sergey_levine|UT HOPELY THAT'S NOT THE THING THAT'S LIKE THE MAIN DRIVING FORCE FOR SOMEBODY
567_sheldon_solomon|THAT MAKES YOU
567_steven_pressfield|A IS SITTING DOWN AND WRITING TO
568_ben_goertzel|BUT I MEAN THAT THERE THER'S CERTAINLY NOT
568_dileep_george|UNDER AND WE ARE USING THAT A VERY  FRUITFULLY IN
568_françois_chollet|SPACE OF POSSIBLE SITUATIONS
568_manolis_kellis|TO NOT TRANSLATE
568_matt_botvinick|WAS THAT IT DIDN'T REQUIRE ANYTHING SPECIAL IT WAS JUST IF YOU TOOK A SYSTEM THAT HAD SOME FORM OF MEMORY
568_peter_singer|IT'S O KAY TO MAKE ONE PERSON
568_richard_karp|I AM TO SHOW THAT
568_sara_seager|THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF EXCITING DEVELOPMENTS WITH NASSA IT PASACKS WITH OTHER COMPANIES
569_françois_chollet|AND AM YOU'VE COVERED SOME OF THEM
569_grant_sanderson|THEY BASICALLY THEY LITERALLY
569_jitendra_malik|COULD BE ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIPS BUT MAINLY WE FOCUS ON THE FACT THAT THERE ARE ENTITIES
569_manolis_kellis|SO THE VIRES BASICALLY HY JACKS YOUR CELLS
569_peter_singer|UFFER EXTREMELY IN ORDER TO MAKE TWO PEOPLE
569_sara_seager|WHILE WORKING TWITH NOWSA TO LAUNCH ASTERNAUTS WHAT'S YOUR SENSE ABOUT E
570_ben_goertzel|A G AIS SHIME I MEAN INCLUDING A BUNCH OF GROUPS AND IN GOOGLE'S MAIN MAIN MOUNTAIN VIEW OFFICE SO YEIT'S TRUE
570_françois_chollet|IT'S ABOUT GOING FROM THAT INFORMATION
570_grant_sanderson|THIS IS THEIR VALUATION METRIC
570_manolis_kellis|CUTS IT CLEAVES EVERY ONE OF YOUR HUMAN ARINESE
570_russ_tedrake|OR THE SAME DESCRIPTION BECAUSE THE ROBET HAD TO GO INTO THIS DISASTER AREA AND
570_sergey_levine|AND THEN ACTUALLY SIT DOWN AND THINK ABOUT THE STEPS THAT ARE NECESSARY TO GET THERE
570_steven_pressfield|HE PUT IN OMUS TE YELL I'M DEAFINLY A
571_françois_chollet|AN ESSENTIALLY DIRATION BETWEEN THAT ARAEA AND DUMONTH INFORMATION YOU START WITH  IS INTELLIGENCE
571_sergey_levine|AND HOPEFULLY THAT THING IS NOT A BETTER NUMBER ON IMAGENIT CLASSIFICATION IT SLICTS PROBABLY LIE AN ACTUAL THING THAT WE CAN'T DO TO DAY THER WILD BE REALLY AFF SOME G
571_steven_pressfield|SOP BUT I'M SORT OF FORTIFYING MYSELF TO
572_dileep_george|ERY HIGH QUALITY GEURNERAL VERY HARD TO A PUBLICAN AND USE IN A USUALLY DIS INDICATING OF THE
572_françois_chollet|SO A A VERY SMART AGENT
572_grant_sanderson|MOST PEOPLE WILL REALIZE I NEVER DO IT
572_ian_hutchinson|YEI FEM I TALKED TO RICHAR DOGIS ON THE SPOTCAST THAN NA M
572_joscha_bach|WHICH IS LIKE
572_matt_botvinick|HE KIND OF METAL LEARNING THAT WE WERE STUDYING
572_peter_singer|A AT SOME POINT
572_richard_karp|VIRTUALLY ALL THE STANDARD COMMENATORIAL PROBLEMS
572_russ_tedrake|THE CHALLEGE COULD HAVE REALLY
572_sergey_levine|AND THEN NATURALLY TE TURN TO YOU
573_ben_goertzel|THERE'S BEEN AN AMAZING MAIN STREAMING YOU CUN SAY THE SAME THING ABOUT SUPERLONGEVITY RESEARCH WHICH IS ONE OF MY
573_françois_chollet|I CAN MAKE EFFICIENT USES OF VERY LITTR
573_manolis_kellis|BECAUSE THEY HAVE A PARTICULAR MARK THAT IT SPARES
573_sergey_levine|OF LIFE WHAT IS THE MEANING OF YOUR LIFE WHAT GIVES YOU FULFILMENT
573_sheldon_solomon|IT MEANS TO BE STEADFAST
573_steven_pressfield|AND A
574_dileep_george|A I KIN I KAIN
574_françois_chollet|WIZAT AT AND KNOWING WAS THIS SHU CHENOU SITUTIONS A ANGING TO ME
574_jitendra_malik|HOW DO YOU SEE THAT INTERACTION
574_joscha_bach|SPECIALLY DEEP LEARNING ESPECIALLY WITH REINFORCEMEN LEARNING
574_manolis_kellis|THEN ALL OF THE RHIBOSOMS THAT NORMALLY MAKE PROTEENE IN YOUR HUMAN SELF ARE NOW
574_peter_singer|D'YOU THINK IT WILL BE POSSIBLE AND AS A GOOD IDEA TO
574_sara_seager|IS PART OF WHAT IT MEANS TO BE HUMAN
574_sergey_levine|PURPOSE HAPPINESS
574_sheldon_solomon|AN AND TO JUST HAVE CONFIDENCE
575_ian_hutchinson|EDGES DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT TO BEGIN BECAUSE IT JUST FEELS LIKE WE KNOW SO LITTLE
575_joscha_bach|THE THE HOPE BEHIND OPENING EYE DEEP MIND ALL THE MAJOR RESULTS
575_peter_singer|PUSHD THAT KIND OF ANALYSIS TO MAKE THEN PUBLIC DECISIONS PERHAPS WITH THE HELP OF A AY
575_sara_seager|SO WANTING TO GO TO ANOTHER PLANET AND AND BE ABLE TO LIVE THERE FOR SOME TIME IT'S JUST
576_ben_goertzel|REALLY TO SAY
576_dileep_george|THE IDEAS THAT WE BROUGHT TOGETHER IN THAT PAPER ARE IN TERMSOF THE IMPORTANCE OF EED BY CONNECTIONS
576_jitendra_malik|REORGANIZATION IS TES DEFINING THE ENTITIES IN THE WORLD
576_manolis_kellis|WHERE THE RIEBOSOM SIPS READING FRAY
576_peter_singer|YOU KNOW HERE'S A TAX RATE
576_russ_tedrake|PLAYED A PRETTY BIG ROLL IN THE COMPETITION
576_steven_pressfield|THE REAL RESISTANCE I THINK FOR ME AND I THINK THIS IS TRUE FOR ANYBODY IS
577_ian_hutchinson|OF THE MISTRALARY WE NEED TO BE A MODEST OR OR HUMBLE EVEN
577_richard_karp|AND MOST IMPORTANT STAGE OF PROGRESS WAS A RESULT BY
577_russ_tedrake|A AND THE DEGREE OF AUTONOMY WASN'T CLEAR
577_sara_seager|OFTENTIMES IN SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
577_sergey_levine|T'S QUITE NICE TOO
578_dileep_george|BATTLE CONNECTIONS
578_jitendra_malik|AND THEN RECONSTRUCTION IS WHAT FILLING IN THE GAPS
578_matt_botvinick|IT JUST HAPPENS IN IN INASENSE
578_peter_singer|AN YET I WOULD BE RIGHT IF WE COULD
578_russ_tedrake|THE DECREE OF ATONOMY WAS ALWAYS A CENTRAL PART OF THE DISCUSSION
578_sara_seager|BIG HUGE DISCOVERIES ARE MADE
578_sergey_levine|TAKE THINGS TO SPEND MY TIME ON THAT I BELIEVE REALLY MATTER
579_françois_chollet|TESTING OF INTELLIGENCE
579_sheldon_solomon|THIS IDEA YOU SAID LOVE EARLIER AND I THINK THAT WHEN HAIDEGER IS TALKING ABOUT BEING SOLICITOUS
580_ben_goertzel|TEN PEOPLE ARE FORCED TO TAKE A
580_dileep_george|AAL JOINEDLY
580_françois_chollet|ALREADI'S FUNDAMENTALLY THE SAME KIND OF VA
580_ian_hutchinson|SO THAT'S SCRUCIAL
580_joscha_bach|IN ORDER TO REDUCE THE UNCERTAINTY IN YOUR MODELS RIGHT SO YOU CAN PIN POINT THE AIRESS IN YOUR MODELS WERE YOURE NOT QUITE SURE YOU JUST MOVE YOUR HEAD AND SEE
580_sara_seager|YOU THINK SOMETHING
580_sergey_levine|I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S EASY TO ANSWER THIS BUT IF YOU'RE SUCCESSFUL
581_grant_sanderson|THERE'S PLENTY OF NEGATIVE FEED BACK THAT'S NOT WELL IN TENTION HE BUT I'M FOR LIKE THAT GOLDEN KIND AH I THINK A LOT OF
581_manolis_kellis|WHICH IS AN ARANY BASED REVERSE FROMSCIPTIRS SO FROM THE ARANY ON THE POSITIVE STRAND IT MAKES AN ARANY ON THE NEGATIVE STRAND
581_richard_karp|SO THE PROPOSITIONOF
581_sergey_levine|WHAT DOES THAT LOOK LIKE
581_sheldon_solomon|THAT IS PERMEATED BY
582_dileep_george|AH THEY DON'T USE THESE INSIGHTS
582_grant_sanderson|YOU TO BEFRIENDS I HAVE AH
582_ian_hutchinson|TAT KIND OF HUILITY
582_manolis_kellis|AND IN BETWEEN EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THESE GENES THESE OPEN READING FRAMES THERE'S A LITTLE SIGNAL
582_peter_singer|DIFFERENT VIEWS ABOUT JUSTICE AND I THINK YOU OUGE TO GIVE
582_richard_karp|LOGIC PROBLEM IS EXPRESSED IN TERMS OF A
582_sara_seager|A DO YOU THINK THERE IS
582_steven_pressfield|INSIDE US CONOMIC A WOMAN'S BIOLOGICAL CLOCK
583_ben_goertzel|WHAT'S YOUR SENSE WITH WITH OPEN COG WITH YOUR WORK IN IN GENERAL
583_dileep_george|THAT IS A DYNAMIC IN THE OUR IN THE COMMUNITY OF INOSO OR
583_ian_hutchinson|IS WHAT JESUS TAUGHT SO I SO I DON'T KNOW WHETHER THIS WAS IN THE BACK OF YOUR MIND WHEN YOU ARE THINKING ABOUT THIS BUT IT'S OFTEN THE CASE THAT
583_jitendra_malik|WORKING ON MANY DIFFERENT PROBLEMS BUT THEY TREATED EACH OF THEM AS A SEPARATE ISOLATED PROMER
583_joscha_bach|O YOU THINK DO YOU THINK WE CAN DO THE SAME KIND OF REASONING A CONSCIOUSNESS INTELLIGENCE IF WE PUT ON
583_sara_seager|VALUE IN TRYING TO
583_sheldon_solomon|IS GETTING FROM HATE
583_steven_pressfield|AND WE HAVE TO SERVE IT
584_jitendra_malik|IF PEOPLE
584_joscha_bach|AVI R HADSET
584_richard_karp|VARIABLES THAT CAN BE EITHER TRUE OR FALSE
584_sara_seager|GOAT PUT HUMANS AN MARS VIRCIVAL AND SECOND OF ALL COLONIZE MARS
585_ian_hutchinson|THINKING YOU KNOW SOMETHING AND NOT LISTENING TO COUNTER ARGUMENTS FR EXAMPLE I'M
585_joscha_bach|AND MOVE OVER TO THAT WORLD
585_manolis_kellis|FOOL NEGATIVE STRANDORINE
585_matt_botvinick|THAT'S SOMETHING THAT'S
585_richard_karp|SO AN INSTANCE OF THE PROBLEM WOULD BE
585_russ_tedrake|YOU'D BE ABLE TO GET A FEW
585_sara_seager|DO YOU THINK THERE'S SOMETHING INTERESTING THAT MIGHT COME FROM THERE
586_ben_goertzel|OCAPTURE A DEEP ELEMENT OF INTELLIGENCE
586_dileep_george|AH INQUIET
586_joscha_bach|WHAT I'LL DO IS SO FROM NOW ON YOU CAN ONLY EXIST IN THE VIRTUAL WORLD AND SO HE PUT ON HIS HEAD SET
586_matt_botvinick|A VERY OBVIOUSLY TRUE OF THE WORLD THAT HUMANS INHABIT WERE
586_russ_tedrake|BITS BACK AND FORTH BUT YOU DON'T GET TO HAVE ENOUGH PREDENTIALLY TO FULLY AH OPERATE THE ROBOT IN EVERY JOINT OF THE ROBOT
586_sara_seager|II'M CONVINCED THERE WILL BE SOMETHING INTERESTING I JUST DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS YET
586_sergey_levine|YOU KNOW THE LONGER THEY EXISTS IN THE WORLD AND THAT KINNA SEEMS LIKE
586_sheldon_solomon|AN SO THAT'S KIND OF MY
586_steven_pressfield|BRU PRINGSTIN
587_ben_goertzel|AT NEEDS TO BE THERE I LIKE YOU SAID N YES TO LEARN HES TO BE AUTOMATE SOMEHOW BUT THAT SEEMS TO BE MISSING FROM A LOT OF THE
587_jitendra_malik|CORRESPONDING ROUGHLY TO THE PSYCHOLOGIST'S ENOTION OF SENSATION PERCEPTION AND COGNITION AND
587_joscha_bach|AND WHEN YOU EAT
587_richard_karp|SO FOR EXAMPLE IF I TAKE AN THE FORMULAR
587_sara_seager|I DON'T THINK HAVING SOMEE COMMERCIAL VALUE OR VALUE IN THE METRIC OF SOMETHING USEFUL IS REALLY WHAT'S MOTIVATING US
587_sheldon_solomon|PREOCCUPATION IS TO TAKE WHAT I JUST SAID TO YOU
588_ben_goertzel|A LOT OF RESEARCH CURRENTLY A
588_ian_hutchinson|WHAT IS IT ACTUALLY SAID OF HOW DO YOU CARRY YOUR FAITH IN TERMS OF THE WAY YOU SEE THE WORLD
588_joscha_bach|ARE COMMONS ARE O REAL WORLD IN THE VIRTUAL WORLD BUT THEN THE POSSIBILITIES BECOME MUCH BIGGER B
588_peter_singer|FROM THE GOVERNMENT
588_richard_karp|A OR B AND A OR NOT B AND NOT A OR B AND NOT A OR NOT B
588_sergey_levine|A UNENDING A COMPLEXITY IN THE UNIVERSE
588_steven_pressfield|BUT THERE'S SOMETHING LIKE THA
589_manolis_kellis|THESE NNEGATIVE STRANDAR INNAS NOW MAKE POSITIVE STRANDAR INNAS
589_peter_singer|EMTIGAT IN THE CASE OF A AI OVERSEEING WHAT IS WHAT KIND OF DECISIONS TAY I CAN MAKE AND NOT
589_richard_karp|AND TAKE  THE CONJUNCTION OF ALL FOUR OF LOSS
589_sheldon_solomon|REMEMBER I SAID EARLIER
590_ben_goertzel|I GUESS ONE WOULD T ASK THIS QUESTION
590_françois_chollet|AN INJECTING
590_ian_hutchinson|IN OUR SOCIETY AT THE MOMENT AN BECAUSE A
590_peter_singer|BUT ALSO A FEW LOOK AT ANIMAL
590_richard_karp|CLOT WHAT ARE CALLED CLAUSES
590_sheldon_solomon|I WASN'T TRAINED IN ANY OF THESE THINGS I'M AN EGG HAD
591_jitendra_malik|AND I WAS AT THAT TIME JUST DOING THIS ON THE BASIS OF INFORMATION FLOOR
591_joscha_bach|TO A GREATER DEGREE THAN WE CERNENTLY HAVE LIVING ON TWITERAN SOLCIAMEDIAN SON
591_russ_tedrake|ROM THE EARLLY IDEA AGES TO ACTUALLY COMPETING
591_sergey_levine|THANKS FOR LISTENING TO THIS CONVERSATION WITH SIRGILEVINE
591_sheldon_solomon|RESEARCHER THAT WAS DUEIN EXPERIMENTS ABOUT BILFEDBACK
592_jitendra_malik|THOU ITTURNS OUT
592_peter_singer|ALLOWING THE PUBLIC TO
592_richard_karp|PROPOSITIONAL LOGIC
592_russ_tedrake|I MEANS THIS WAS A DEFINING EXPERIENCE FOR ME
592_sheldon_solomon|AND YOU KNOW THEN WE READ THESE BACKER BOOKS AND I THOUGHT THEY WERE SO INTERESTING THAT
592_steven_pressfield|IKE OLYMPIC ATHLETES VISUALIZED GETTING THE GOLD METAL
593_ben_goertzel|ARE MANY MANY DIFFERENT APPROACHES THAT CAN WORK FOR GETTING TOTO HUMAN LEVEL THEY AYE SO I DON'T I DON'T THINK
593_dileep_george|I AND I DON'T FEET
593_ian_hutchinson|YOU KNOW A OR OR BELIEVING THINGS THAT AN AN ARE NOT PROVEN O K
593_sergey_levine|AND EXPRESSVY P NE
593_sheldon_solomon|FOR THE FIRST FEW YEARS WE DIDN'T HAVE ANY STUDIES
593_steven_pressfield|IDOU I OL THAT THEY GO THROUGH
594_ben_goertzel|THEIRS LIKE ONE
594_ian_hutchinson|AH
594_jitendra_malik|PORSED THE DEEP LEARNING REVOLUTION THAT THIS THIS ARCHITECTURE
594_joscha_bach|DEN I THINK THAT CORUNDY IS SA WASTE OF TIME TO DEAR WITH THE PHYSICAL VERGE BEFORE WE HAVE MECHANISMS THAT CAN AUTOMATICALLY LEARN HOW TO DEA VIS IT DO
594_peter_singer|IN A SENSE YOU COULD IMAGINE I
594_sara_seager|WE CAN'T EVEN TRET I MEAN IT WOULD TAKE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF YEARS TO GET THERE WITH CONVENTIONAL METHODS SO YOU KNOW THE MOVIS LAGRATIONAL MALTIDENTIALLY HA
594_sergey_levine|PLEASE CONSIDER SUPPORTING THIS POT CASS BY DOWNLODING CASHAP
595_ben_goertzel|ALGERA THERE WANT ONE GOLDEN DESIGN ATHAT THAT  THAT CAN WORK AND AMIN FLYING MACHINES
595_dileep_george|INNO  I AM LOOKING INTO THE DETAILS OF BARLAGI ANT
595_jitendra_malik|AS TURNED OUT TO BE READY AH
595_joscha_bach|IF YOU IF THERE'S NOTHING TO CONTROL YOU CANNOT MAKE MODALS RIGHT THERE NEEDS TO BE A PARTICULAR WAY THAT RESISTS YOU
595_manolis_kellis|THE ENVELOPE PROTING THE MEMBRANE PROTIN THE NUCLIOCAPTURED PROTEN TAT WILL PACKAGE UP THE ARENAE AND THEN SOULD OF CREATING NEW VIRAL ENVELOPES
595_matt_botvinick|VALIDATING WHAT WE'RE DOING ON THE A EYE SIDE IF WE CAN GAIN SOME EVIDENCE THAT THE BRAIN IS USING SOME
595_peter_singer|WISE AND BENEVOLENT YOU KNOW OMNI BENEVOLENT DE LEADER WHO WOULD DO THAT BETTER THAN DEMOCRACIES COULD
595_richard_karp|IS THAT DEM EVERY PROBLEM
595_sara_seager|YET THIS MOVY PASSENGER HAVE YOU SEEN THAT MOVY
595_sheldon_solomon|MUT MY PRESENT VIEW AS I MIKE HERE'S WHAT THIS HYDREGERGY SAYS
596_françois_chollet|SO PRIOR IS WHATEVER IN FORMATION ARE YOU HAVE ABOUT A GIVEN TASK BEFORE YOU START LEARNING ABOUT THIS TASK
596_grant_sanderson|BUT EXACTLY RIGHT EM THE POINT I WAS GOING TO MAKE THOSE LIKE I KNOW I'M BAD ABOUT FALLOING UP ON STUFF
596_ian_hutchinson|FAITH ALSO MMEANS
596_jitendra_malik|CONDUCIVE TO THAT
596_joscha_bach|AND A IT FORCES YOUR MIND
596_manolis_kellis|AND THESE WILL THEN BE SECRETED OUT OF THAT CELL
596_peter_singer|IN THE WELD IN WHICH WE LIVE
596_richard_karp|AND IN P
596_sara_seager|PASSENGER IT'S ABOUT A BIG SPACESHIP THAT
596_sheldon_solomon|THESE IDEAS
597_françois_chollet|AND HAS A DIFFERENCE FROM EXPERIENCE
597_jitendra_malik|BECAUSE ABASICALY IN THESE
597_richard_karp|HE USED THE OBSERVATION THAT A VERY SIMPLE ABSTRACT MACHINE CALLED THE TOURING MACHINE
597_russ_tedrake|AN
597_sergey_levine|CLICK ALL THE LYNKS
598_françois_chollet|WHAT EXPENSE IS ACQUIRED
598_grant_sanderson|AVE A SENSE OF WHAT WILL BE LIKE GOOD CONTENT WHEN IT WON'T BE AHM
598_ian_hutchinson|TRUSTING IN A PERS
598_joscha_bach|IS THERE ANYTHING
598_matt_botvinick|SCALE TO RICH COMPLEX TASKS THAT ITLL
598_sergey_levine|BY ALL THE STUFF
599_dileep_george|HOW DOES THE BRAIN DO THIS
599_françois_chollet|A PRIOS ABOUT A A NA JEORGANIZATION OF TO DE SPACE
599_manolis_kellis|OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN AND YET NEVER FOULLY WIPED OUT
599_richard_karp|ANY AL GRYTHAN IA ANAL GRYTM FOR ANY
599_russ_tedrake|MOMENT WHERE WERE ALL SUPERTIRED AND
599_sara_seager|AB WE END UP SENDING
599_sergey_levine|IT'S THE BEST WAY TO SUPPORT THIS POTCAST AND THE JOURNEY AM ON
600_ben_goertzel|OF THE THEORY OF ARODONOMICS AND THAT
600_dileep_george|AUSE TAT'S GOING TO BE REALLY HELPFUL FOR ENGINEERING INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS
600_françois_chollet|AND THE RULES OF HAU
600_ian_hutchinson|AND I TRY TO ACT IN FAITH TOWARDS HER AND THAT'S A KIND OF LOYALTY
600_joscha_bach|
600_peter_singer|WITH GOOD INTENTIONS AND THEN HAVE ENDED UP BEING CORRUPT AND FAVOURING THEMSELVES AH SI
600_sergey_levine|SKABON YOU TO
601_ben_goertzel|THAT'S WHAT MARKIS HUTER
601_dileep_george|YES YOU NEED SO I THINK IT IS ITS ONE INPUT AND IT IS IT IS SCOUTFUL
601_grant_sanderson|FRUSTRATED USUALLY IN A BENEVOLENT WAY THAT LIKE
601_manolis_kellis|BI BY NO MEANS BASICALLY SO SO LET ME EXPLAIN THE BACKDEAT
601_matt_botvinick|SINCE THE TWO FIELDS I YOU KNOW JOINTLY EXISTED AM
601_russ_tedrake|AND REEMEMBER ATLAS WAS POWERED DOWN HANGING LIMP EEN ON THE ON ITS HARNESS
602_dileep_george|BUT YOU YOU SHOULDN'T KNOW
602_françois_chollet|OIT'S INTERESTING TO THINK ABOUT THE GAME OF GOS HOW MANY PRIORS ARE AS SHE BROUGHT TO THE TABLE
602_jitendra_malik|DEATH THERE ITS PART OF THE CERATIAN SPACE
602_manolis_kellis|KILLED WHAT THIRTY PERSENT OF EUROPE
602_peter_singer|MAYBE THIS IS A GOOD TIME TO ASK YOU'VE TEN YEARS AGO WROTE THE LIFE YOU CAN SAVE THAT'S NOW IF
602_richard_karp|ON ONE OF THESE  TOURING MACHINES WHICH ARE EXTREMELY SIMPLE
602_russ_tedrake|
602_sheldon_solomon|IT JUST LIKE REFUSES TO BE CONVENTIONAL YE I A SO SA CONSTANT A
602_steven_pressfield|YOU KNOW A HUNDRED PAGES INTO THE OTHER
603_dileep_george|THEN TO DEVIATE FROM IT TO UM SO AN EXAMPLE ESKON WILLUSION NURAL NITWORKS RIGHT A
603_matt_botvinick|GIVEN THE BURST OF
603_sara_seager|BODY PARTS I MEAN THE VING IS IT IS SO HARD TO GET TO ANOTHER PLANET THAT THIS THOUGHT OF
603_sheldon_solomon|LEAP INTO THE UNKNOWN AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HE DOES
603_steven_pressfield|WHEN YOU FINISH THE NET THE FIRST ONE BUT IT ISN' IT IS A
604_dileep_george|CONVOLUTION IS NOT AN OPPRESSION BRAIN IN ER IMPLEMENTS THE VISHAL COTICS IS NOT CONVOLUSE NOT
604_françois_chollet|O START FROM
604_grant_sanderson|WHAT'S COMFORTING THOUGHT FOR ME IS THAT
604_ian_hutchinson|YOU KNOW DON'T HAVE PROOF OF FOQE IM BUT BUT THE CRITICS OF RELIGION GENERALLY
604_jitendra_malik|THIS A PROBLEM OF COMPUTIVISION IN
604_matt_botvinick|INNOVATION THAT'S HAPPENED RECENTLY ON THE A E SIDE
604_russ_tedrake|SO SO WE WERE USING GIZEBO AS A SIMULATOR ON THE CLOUD THERE IS ALL THESE INTERESTING CHALLENGES I THINK AM
604_sheldon_solomon|THAT ARE GOING TO BE ACCOMPLISHED THAT A LOT OF OTHERS ARE SAYING ARE IMPOSSIBLE THAT CATONOMOUS VEHICLES
605_dileep_george|WESHAL GORTEX  HAS
605_françois_chollet|A DISSAME SET OF PRIOL STETUMAN START WITH
605_joscha_bach|IF THE BOTTLE NECK IS LITERALLY THE INFORMATION
605_matt_botvinick|AM AND INOSER IN SOME WAYS
605_sheldon_solomon|HE TRULY BELIEVES IT TO ME THAT IS THE LEAP OF FAITH OF AN WAT WAS GOING LIKE
605_steven_pressfield|TO THINK OH THIS IP GET A WIN THE OSCAR YO KNOW
606_ben_goertzel|WHAT YOU WOULD DO AS SAY WELL LET'S LET'S TAKE
606_jitendra_malik|A RECONSTRUCTION HOW MUCH OF IT CAN BE LEARNED END TO END DO YOU THINK
606_manolis_kellis|THERE'S BEEN SERIES OF WIPING OUT OF HUGE FRACTIONS OF ENTIRE SPECIES OR JUST ENTIRE SPECIALTOGETHER
606_richard_karp|FACT BUT AN ALGRYTHM FOR
606_sara_seager|TO THINK OF THE IDEA THAT WE WOULD LAUNCH A SUCCESSFUL
607_ian_hutchinson|WHEN THEY DON'T HAVE ALL
607_russ_tedrake|SO AND YOU KNOW UP TO THE VIRTUAL COMPETITIONS SO THE VIRTUAL COMPETITION
607_sara_seager|SPACESHIP THAT HASMULTIGENERATIONAL LIKE NON HUMAN LIFE
608_ben_goertzel|INSAMELY MUCH PROCESSING POWER RATHER THAN INFINITLY MUH WHAT AS TEE ELL TAND FOR A TANT TIME AND LA
608_ian_hutchinson|THE PROOF OR EVIDENCE OR KNOWLEDGE THAT ENABLES YOU TO MAKE A COMPLETELY AM
608_peter_singer|TO HELP PEOPLE IN EXTREME POVERTY
608_russ_tedrake|WAS YOU WILL SIGN ON AT A CERTAIN TIME
608_sheldon_solomon|AND OF COURSE PEOPLE ARE LIKE DUDE THAT'S CRAZY AND THERE'S A GUY WAS IT'S
609_grant_sanderson|TOUCH MEANING I GUESS TA FOCUS ON THE FUTURE ON THE THING YOU ARE CREATING NOW JUST LIKE THE A THE OTH ART OF IT ONE OF THE PEOPLE IS REALLY
609_manolis_kellis|EUROPE WAS SHAPED
609_steven_pressfield|KAND OSOVIAEN EGO
610_ben_goertzel|IS EACH EACH EACH ACTION THAT I WAS TO TAKE
610_dileep_george|AM IN INDIVIDUAL CRODICTS THAT HE SAID
610_françois_chollet|MAGT BE A WEAR QUESTION BUT WHAT ARE LIKE THE FIRST PRINCIPLES
610_jitendra_malik|AND AND THAT I WOULD ARGUE IS A TOO NARROW A VIEW OF THE PROBLEM
610_joscha_bach|I RECENTLY RERET THOMAS OK HINESS IT'S VERY INTERESTING TO SEE THIS BECAUSE HE WAS NOT DUELLAS
610_matt_botvinick|NO I DON'T OFTEN MEET PEOPLE LIKE THAT AS SO YE D'YOU THINK
610_richard_karp|DESCRIBE
610_russ_tedrake|S RUNNINIMULATOR  EUROB
611_françois_chollet|OF THE
611_grant_sanderson|AS I'VE REALLY SEEN IT IN PERSONS A JOROGEN
611_matt_botvinick|THESE TWO REALMS
611_russ_tedrake|AND YOUR CONTROLLER WILL RUN ON THIS THIS CONTROLLER THIS COMPUTER AND THEN THE PHYSICS WILL RUN ON THE OTHER AND YOU HAVE TO TO
611_sara_seager|LIKE THE DREAM
611_sheldon_solomon|HE'S LIKE YEU KNOWE
612_jitendra_malik|IN THE SUPERVISE SETTING
612_joscha_bach|SO BESIE DE THESE THREE RATIONAL PRINCIPLES CALL RATIONALITY WHE CALLS PRUDENCE OR WISDOM E THE SOCIAL REGULATION IS JUSTICE
612_manolis_kellis|AND IF YOU LOK AT THE FREQUENCY OF SECLSELE DISEASE AND THE FREQUENCY OF MALARIA
612_matt_botvinick|AND IS THAT SOMETHING YOU SEE EVERYBODY SHOULD BE DOING CAN BE DOING
612_peter_singer|LIVING IN A LIFE THAT IS
612_richard_karp|ALGRATM FOR A PROBLEM N P COULD BE EXPRESSED AS A SEQUENCE OF
613_ben_goertzel|WOULD LIKE TO DO TO MAKE AN A G I AND WHAT WILL PROBABLY BE DONE FIFTY YEARS FOR NOW TO MAKE AN AG I A SAIL CARE WHAT WE WE WE HAVE
613_françois_chollet|SO IT'S A FIL WISIR WIS A FERY LONG HISTORY
613_grant_sanderson|DOESN'T GIVE A DAM
613_ian_hutchinson|JUST JUST TO CORRECT OF THE IMPLICATION THAT YOU MADE I I DON'T THINK IT'S NECESSARILY THE CONTHE CONSEQUENCE OF ATHEISM
613_peter_singer|BARLY OR PERHAPS NOT AT ALL
613_russ_tedrake|THEY WANTED IT TO RUN AT REAL TIME RATES
613_steven_pressfield|TER
614_ben_goertzel|SOME CONSTRAINTS WE HAVE THESE PROCESSING POWER CONSTRAINTS
614_grant_sanderson|LIKE LEGITIMATE
614_jitendra_malik|I  IT A KAN OF EZA I SORT OF A LIMITED VIEW OF THE
614_russ_tedrake|BECAUSE THERE WAS AN ELEMENT OF HUMAN INTERACTION EAND HUMANS WCUN IF YOU DO WANT TA TELYOP IT WORKS WAY BETTER IF IT AID FRAME RI
615_ben_goertzel|WE KNOW WE HAVE SPACE AND TIME CONSTRAINTS ONE PROGRAMME WE HAVE ENERGY UTILIZATION CONSTRAINTS
615_dileep_george|LIK THE COPPING OF THE WETS LIKE THE U THE WEITS IN THE CENTR ARE VERY DIFFERENT FROM THE WEITS IN THE PADIFERY YES THE PROFER AMIE ATDITIS A
615_françois_chollet|THE IDEAL GOLS OF THE FIELD ES OU NOTESTE SHOULD BE
615_ian_hutchinson|ARE RELATED
615_jitendra_malik|OF THE LEARNING PROCESS
615_manolis_kellis|ALL THE GENETIC ASSOCIATIONS THAT WE DO WITH HUMAN DISEASE
615_richard_karp|READING A SYMBOLON THE TAPE
615_russ_tedrake|ULCLE BUT IT WAS VERY HARD TO STIMULATE THESE
616_dileep_george|UNDERSTOOD THING
616_grant_sanderson|JUST LIKE THE RICHNESS AND TH E DEPTH OF A SMILE HE HAS WHEN HE JUST EXPERIENCES THE MOMENT WITH YOU LIKE OFF LINE
616_joscha_bach|THAT THET THE CHRISTIAN CONSPIRACY FORCES YOU TO BELIEVE SOME GUI IS A LONG BEARD THAT RE TEY DISCOVERED THIS BUT A
616_peter_singer|A MINIMUM ETHICAL STANDARD OF GIVING
616_richard_karp|WHILE YOU'RE IN A GIVEN STATE AND MOVING TO A NEW STATE AND LEAVING BEHIND THE NEW SET NEW SYMBOL AND GIVEN THAT
616_sara_seager|ND SO FAINT COMPARED TO OUR SON
617_françois_chollet|IT SHOULD BE THATTE
617_ian_hutchinson|IT'S I THINK IT'S A QUESTION THAT ALWAYS ARISES WHEL WHERE DOES THE WHERE DI THES COME FROM
617_jitendra_malik|BEYOND PURELY SUPERVISED LOOK AT BACK TO CHILDREN YOU MENTION SIX LESSONS THAT WE CAN LEARN FROM CHILDREN
617_sara_seager|IMAGINE THAT AND REVISITED EVERY DECADE UNTIL NOW WHEN WE THINK WE CAN ACTUALLY BUILD IT AND STAR SHADE
617_sheldon_solomon|HAS GENERALLY BEEN INITIATED BY SOMEONE WHO WAS CONDEMNED FOR BEING A LUNATIC
617_steven_pressfield|THE EGO SERVES A MORE IMPORTANT ROLE
618_ben_goertzel|FORMAL SPECIFICATION LANGUAGE YOU SHOULD THEN BE ABLE TO
618_jitendra_malik|OF B MULTIMOTO BEING CREMENTAL B PHYSICAL EXPLORE BESOCIAL USE LANGUAGE CAN IS
618_richard_karp|NONE THE TERMINISTIC POLONOMIAL TIME ALKRTHEM CAN BE
618_sheldon_solomon|IT'S NOT THAT ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE BUT SURELY
618_steven_pressfield|I THINK THEN IT DOES IN WRITING EH THE EGO THERE'S SOMETHING
619_françois_chollet|TO FIND SENSE IF YOUR IFYOUR SAYING THAT YOUR MEASURING INTELLIGENCE THEN
619_steven_pressfield|WELL NOT LEME WHEN YOU SAY THAT I KNOW WHAT YOU MEN LAXINI DO THINK THERE IS
620_ben_goertzel|THE COMPUTING RESOURCE CONSTRAINTS AND THE PARTICULAR ENVIRONMENT IN GOAL AND THEN IT WILL SPIT OUT
620_dileep_george|YOU CAN STILL APPLY ENGINEERING TLICKS WEN WER YO WANT ET TO YOU DON'T WANT TO BE SLAVISHLY MAKING ALL THE THINGS OF THE BRAIN
620_françois_chollet|MEANING THAT FOR INSTANCE IF YOURE IF YOUR TEST INVOLVES A THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE
620_jitendra_malik|DEVELOP MEANT PEOPLE IT'S JUST THAT
620_joscha_bach|THE SOCIETY OF THE UESSES THE SOCIETY OF TEATERS EDSPACICALLY
620_manolis_kellis|BUT WERE TRUALLY INTERESTING THE HUMAN GENOR ES THAT WE HAVE CO OPTED MANY OF THESE IMMUNE GENES TO CARRY OUT NON IMMUNE FUNCTIONS
620_richard_karp|HOW AMAZING IS THAT
620_russ_tedrake|AND THAT WAS GREAT FOR ME BECAUSE MY CONTROLLER WAS SOLVING A BIT PRETTY BIG OPTIMIZATION PROBLEM
620_steven_pressfield|E MOST INTERESTING TO WATCH INTERVIEWS W WITH STEFF CURRY AND WHOS
621_dileep_george|AND AND SO YES IT SHOULD B ON IN POOD AND I THINK IT IS
621_jitendra_malik|SO THEN THE CHILD SOS THE CHILD HOLDS A BALL AND PLAYS WITH IT SO AT THAT POINT IT'S GETTING A TOUCH SIGNAL
621_matt_botvinick|BOUGHT ME A TICKET TO BE INVOLVED IN ALL OF THE AMAZING THINGS THAT ARE GOING ON IN A I RESEARCH RIHT NOW AM
622_ben_goertzel|RIGHT BUT BU
622_grant_sanderson|IT IS WHAT WE'RE DOING GOING TO MAKE FOR A GOOD INSTA GRAM PHOD OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT IT DOESN'T THNK LIKE THAT AT ALL A IT'S
622_peter_singer|O RESEARCH IN AN AREA WHERE THE PAYOP COULD BE GRIGT THERE ARE LOT OF DIFFERENT OPPORTUNITIES
622_russ_tedrake|AND I REMEMBER GETTING THE SEAMALE
622_sara_seager|THSO THAT YOU CAN SEE THE PLANET DIRECTLY AND STAR SHADE
622_steven_pressfield|SUCH TREMENDOUS SELF CONFIDENCE
623_ben_goertzel|THAT'S A VERY RUSH SEEMS REALLY IN AFFAIR THE VERY RUSSIAN APPROACH BUSTWAY LIKE THE WHOLE FIELD OF PROGRAM SPECIALIZATION KCATE KATE CAME OUT OF VROSSIA
623_dileep_george|SO OQET THAT'S REALLY COOL BUT THAT'S WORK FROM A FEW YEARS AGO
623_ian_hutchinson|AM IN MERE HUMAN RELATIONSHIPS
623_jitendra_malik|IS GETTING AS THE NOTION OF TREEDY SHAPE BUT IT IS PASS
623_matt_botvinick|HAVING SAID ALL THAT I
623_peter_singer|UT THEY MAY NOT FIND THAT IS FULFILLING AS ACTUALLY KNOWING THAT THEY ARE MAKING A POSITIVE DIFFERENCE TO THE WORLD
623_richard_karp|WHY THIS IS
623_steven_pressfield|THE BEST HE KIN BE HIM BEING IN THE FLOW
624_dileep_george|NOW IS THERE SOME INTERESTING ASPECTS WHERE
624_françois_chollet|AH ININSETICOUS STATISTICAL TERMS YOU WOULD EXPLAIN THEM WITH THE LEDEN VEBLE
624_manolis_kellis|ISHOL USE OR LUSING
624_matt_botvinick|I THINK THE I THINK THE BEST
624_sheldon_solomon|AND AND TO LOOK AT ALL THE OPPORTUNITIES Y LAYS THAT'S RIGHT LET ME ASK YOU
624_steven_pressfield|AND YOU KNOW WA
625_dileep_george|THERE IS AN ADJUSTMENT TO YOUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE BRAIN OR IS AT ALL JUST BUILDING O TOP TO EACH OTHER
625_françois_chollet|AND THE LITT EN VIABLE LET WUOINSTANCE EXPLAIN
625_grant_sanderson|ABOUT TAN
625_ian_hutchinson|THERE IS A SENSE IN WHICH AM
625_jitendra_malik|RIGHT AND THEN THESE MAP ONTO THESE NERONAL FIBRES ARE GETTING ACTIVATED SOMEWHERE
625_joscha_bach|RS T BENEFITS ACTUALLY OUTWEIGH THE
625_russ_tedrake|WAS HE WAS STILL IN LAB I
625_steven_pressfield|A CHORIOGRAPHER OR FILM MAKER OR WHATEVER MIGHT DA
626_joscha_bach|THE ARE THE NEGARIV FAX
626_peter_singer|AND MY IDEA IS
626_richard_karp|IN TERMS OF
626_russ_tedrake|FRANK WE NEED TO MAKE TE TRODRATIC PROGRAMMING SOLVER FASTER NOT LIKE A LITTLE FASTER IT'S ACTUALLY YOU KNOW I'M
627_ben_goertzel|OF THINKING ABOUT A EVOLUTION  EVOLTION THAT WAY THAT WAY ALSO WRITES N
627_dileep_george|BUT MANY THINGS WILL BE CONSISTENT WITH THAT BECAUSE IT ITS A BLUR IN A VENU ENU INOM DEEP LEARNING SYSTEMS ARE ALSO IN A MOTILEE HIERARCHICAL
627_françois_chollet|A COGNITIV ABILITY RIGHT AND THE G FACTOR
627_grant_sanderson|BUT AT THE SAME TIME THE NATURE OF OUR PLATFORMS IS SUCH THAT
627_jitendra_malik|RIGHT SO THAT A VERY VERY STRONG CROSS CALEBRATION SIGNAL
627_joscha_bach|HOW DO WE GET TO WHICH SYSTEMOF GOVERNOR IS BEST
627_manolis_kellis|UR JUST NOT UTILIZED
627_richard_karp|SATISFIABILITY PROBLEM
627_sara_seager|THAT IS TENBILLION TIMES FAINTER THAN THE STAR
628_ian_hutchinson|AND THAT WE
628_steven_pressfield|DID I CAN DO THIS YOU KNOW
629_ben_goertzel|WHAT WERE THINKING OF AS A HUMAN
629_grant_sanderson|PEOPLE WHO ARE REALLY CLOSE TO YOU WHO ARE INCREDIBLE PEOPLE HAV BEEN
629_joscha_bach|I SUSPECT THAT A WE CAN FIND A WAY BACK TO A  BY THINKING ABOUT THE WAY IN WHICH OUR BRAIN HAS TO ORGANIZE ITSELF
629_richard_karp|TO THE P EQUALS ENPY QUESTION BECAUSE ALL IT TAKES US TO SHOW THAT ONE
629_sara_seager|GOES TO THE TELESCOPE
629_sheldon_solomon|OR NOT DON'T THINK OF THAT IS A COMPELLING
630_dileep_george|A LOT OF THINGS ARE DIFFERENT AN AN AND THOSE DETAILS
630_françois_chollet|A SINGOL
630_grant_sanderson|AU A I MADE A GREAT COMMUNITY THAT YOU CAN LEARN LOT FROM THE COST OF LISTENING TO THOSE FOLKS
630_ian_hutchinson|GROUND ARE THE
630_peter_singer|AN KNOW THAT THEY ARE DOING SOMETHING SIGNIFICANT TO PLAY THEIR PART IN
630_richard_karp|YA SO WHEN I SAW A COOK'S PAPER AND SAW
630_sara_seager|YES A IN FORMATION MEANING THE TELESCOPE FLIES
630_sheldon_solomon|THE SCRIPTURN
631_françois_chollet|A A EUNIQ VIBOL A
631_ian_hutchinson|NO OTHER PEOPLE
631_jitendra_malik|THE OC AND ARDIO VISUEL SO THERE IS SOME EVENT THAT HAPPENS IN THE WORLD AND THAT EVENT HAS A VISUAL SIGNATURE
631_manolis_kellis|WHICH IS CO OPTED TO DO NONI MUN THINGS IF YOU LOOK AT OUR ADEPOSITES
631_sara_seager|IN NO LES YOUE GITEN PRESENTATION ON US BUT LIKE IT IT WOULD FLY
632_françois_chollet|AND MENTIOND ABOUT PSACHOMETRICS
632_grant_sanderson|COST OF YOUR PSYCHOLOGY SLOWLY BEING DEGRADED BY THE NATURAL UNDERLYING TEXICITY OF THE INTERNITE
632_jitendra_malik|ANITAZA
632_joscha_bach|NATURAL TRANSITIONS
632_peter_singer|IN THE WORLD AND PEOPLE LIVING AFFLUENT LIVES
632_sara_seager|I ENAM
633_ian_hutchinson|IN THE WEST THANKFULLY SHIED AWAY FROM AR IN THE IN THE PAST TO A HALF OR THREE QUARTERS OF A CENTURY
633_joscha_bach|AND THER ARE NOT THAT MANY NATURAL TRANSITIONS AVAILABLE AT ANY GIVEN POINT
633_matt_botvinick|IT'S BEEN A GOOD THING
633_richard_karp|TO THE SATISFIABILITY PROBLEM OF PROPOSITION ON LOGIC
633_russ_tedrake|SO WE ARE SOLVING A BIG OPTIMIZATION PROBLEM AT EVERY TIME STEP
633_sara_seager|YOU WOULDN'T ACTUALLY BE BLOCKING AT
633_sheldon_solomon|THEY OFTEN
633_steven_pressfield|YOU ARE SO YOU REALLY PUT YOURSELF IN THE WORLD
634_ben_goertzel|I XE YOUR SCHMIDUBERD'S GIRDLE MACHINE OR HES INFINITE INFINITELY POWERFUL
634_dileep_george|AM SO
634_grant_sanderson|I THINK THAT'S A GOOD LESSON FOR SOCIAL MEDIATE USAGE
634_ian_hutchinson|I THINK IT IS THE CASE THAT
634_jitendra_malik|SMASHING SOUND AND I SEE THE PIECES OF GLASS
634_joscha_bach|MORIN A NATURAL TRANSITION THOUGH WE' RIGHT NOT TO HAVE REVOLUTIONS IF HE CAN HAS IT RIGHT
634_manolis_kellis|AN THESE ARE AGAIN IMUNSELLS THAT ARE RESIDENT AND LIVING WITHIN THESE STISUES SO
634_richard_karp|THAT MEANT THAT THE SATISFIABILITY PROBLEM WAS A UNIVERSAL COMMENTORIAL PROBLEM
634_sheldon_solomon|DON'T SAY ANYTHING
635_jitendra_malik|CA BELT
635_joscha_bach|AH SO SPEAKING OF REVOLUTIONS AND THE CONNECTION BETWEEN GOVERNMENT SYSTEMS AND THE MIND YOUAVE ALSO SAID THAT DA
635_manolis_kellis|THAT HUMANS HAVE BUSILY MADE IT SO FAR
635_matt_botvinick|A IS IS REALLY HEALTHY
635_peter_singer|OR SOME OF OUR HUMAN NATURES MAY BE MOST OF OUR HUMAN NATURE THAT
635_richard_karp|IT OCCURRED TO ME THROUGH EXPERIENCE I HAD HAD IN TRYING TO SOLVE OTHER COMMENATORIAL PROBLEMS
635_sara_seager|AND SO INSTEAD OF BLOCKING OUT THE LIGHT YOU'R EXPECTING TO SEE NOTHING YOU WOULD SEE RIPPLES
635_steven_pressfield|SO YET NO IT'S NOT LONELY AT ALL FACT I'M MORE LONELY
636_peter_singer|DOING  THE
636_steven_pressfield|SOMETIMES LATER OR GOING OUT TO DINNER WITH SOME PEOPLE AND ACTUAL TALKING O PEOPLE
637_ben_goertzel|IT'S I HOW DO YOU HOW DO YOU TAKE THESE MAXIMILY GENERAL LEARNING PROCESSES AND HOW DO YOU
637_ian_hutchinson|MORAL BELIEFS THAT IS MORE THAN MERE
637_jitendra_malik|ASEPARATING OUT MALTAPALE SPEAKERS
637_joscha_bach|IN THE CONTEXT OF THE MIND
637_manolis_kellis|ITS JUST WHATEVER SURVIVED
637_matt_botvinick|I THINK UM I SEE IT ALL THE TIME AT DEEP MIND
637_peter_singer|THE ETHICAL THING
637_richard_karp|SEEMED TO HAVE THAT UNIVERSAL STRUCTURE
638_ben_goertzel|HOW DO YOU SPECIALIZE THEM SO THAT THEY CAN OPERATE WITHIN THE RESOURCE CONSTRAINTS ATYOU HAVE
638_grant_sanderson|HAS BEEN CHALLENGED NOW WITH THE CURRENT SITUATION AND WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT
638_joscha_bach|WHAT'S THE ROLE OF EMOTION
638_manolis_kellis|AND IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE SURVIVING ONE BACK THEN NOT BECAUSE IT WAS BETTER
638_sheldon_solomon|THERE'S SOMETHING TO REALLY HINK ABOUT HER
639_ben_goertzel|TWO DOMENTION AL MIPIN IT RIGHT AND IT DOES NOT HAVE A SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY TO MENTION A MAPINIT SOME I MEAN WE
639_dileep_george|DANGEROUS CUT TO MAKE BECAUSE
639_françois_chollet|INFORMATION ABOUT THE STRUCTURE
639_jitendra_malik|SAID THE MAL DE MOTTIMAU DEAUX
639_peter_singer|NEVER BEING UIF YOU LIKE NEVER NEVER BEING BORED SITTING ROUND ER YOU KNOW WHAT WILL I DO NEXT I'VE GONOTHING TO DO
639_richard_karp|FROM THE SATISFIABILITY
639_sheldon_solomon|A LOT OF FAMOUS
639_steven_pressfield|EVEN THE BEARGUARD HA HA HE MAY BE ESPECIALLY THE BAG ESPECIALLY THE BARGARS
640_françois_chollet|I OF DEHUMON MIND BATKERA BY THE STRUCTURE
640_grant_sanderson|AND YOU O YOU WANT ALIVE WHICH IS DIFFERENT THAN USUALLY DO MAYBE ONE CAN YOU TALK ABOUT
640_ian_hutchinson|S OFF EN THE SILLIEST
640_manolis_kellis|FOR EXAMPLE OBISITY ORBISTI WAS SELECTED FOR
640_sara_seager|AND THOSE RIPPLES OF LIGHT
641_dileep_george|NEW BIOPHYSICAL MECHANISMS NEWCHANOS
641_ian_hutchinson|IT'S INTERESTING TO ME AN ON THE SOCIOLOGICAL LEVEL THAT DONE
641_joscha_bach|COMMON DAY PARLANS WE DO N'T DON'T I THINK THAT IN EMOTION IS THA CONFIGRATION OF THE COGNITIVE SYSTEM N
641_matt_botvinick|EXPERIMENTAL WORK ON HUMAN AGENT INTERACTION AND AM
641_richard_karp|ONE OF THE OTHER PROBLEMS WOULD BE A
642_dileep_george|AH ARE BEING DISCOVERED ALL THE TIME SO I DON'T WANT TO APFRONTKILOF AN A A LEARNING ALGERDOM
642_françois_chollet|A CERTAIN PICTURE OF THE HUMAN MIND AND THAT'S INTERESTING AND THAT'S WHAT'S RIVEN TO A I THE STRUCTURE OF HUMAN CONCIABIITIES
642_jitendra_malik|SO NOCHOMSKY BELIEVES THAT LANGUAGE MAY BE AT  CORE OF COGNITION AT THE COR OF EVERYTHING IN THE HUMAN MIND
642_manolis_kellis|THEY ROSE TO FORTY FOUR PER CENT FREQUENCYIN EUROPO SPASE BECAUSE YOU BASICALLY WENT THROUGH THE ICE AGES AND THERE WAS A SCARCITY OF FOOD
642_peter_singer|INTERESTING THOUGHTFUL AND GOOD PEOPLE AS WELL AND HAVING FRIENDS OF THAT SORT IS ANOTHER BIG CONTRIBUTION TO HAVING A GOOD LIFE
642_russ_tedrake|NEARBY SOLUTIONS TO THE QUADRATIC PROGRAMME
642_sara_seager|THE LIGHT BENDS AROUND THE EDGES BUT INTERACTS WITH ITSELF AN AWAY TO GIVE YOU A VERY VERY DARK IMAGE
642_steven_pressfield|I HAVE READ THAT IN A POST
643_ben_goertzel|AT AGE AH TWENTY AND THIRTY AND FORTY AN FIFTY SIX I DON'T THINK HII THINK IT'S MORE COMPLEX THAN THAT BECAUSE
643_françois_chollet|I  GIVES YOU AN INSIGHT INTO AND MEAN TO ME REMEMBER WHEN I LEARN ABOUT G FACTOR
643_grant_sanderson|NERVE RACKING UM IT WAS A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT LIKE
643_ian_hutchinson|WHATEVER THEYRE ACTUALLY GROUDED IN
643_jitendra_malik|WHAT IS THE CONNECTION BETWEEN LANGUAGE AND VISION TO YOU
643_richard_karp|SOLVING A DETERMINING WHETHER THERE 'IS A SOLUTION TO A
643_russ_tedrake|WERE WHICH WERE VERY EASILY CHECKED
643_sheldon_solomon|AND THEY WOULD BE WELL  I DON'T THINK ABOUT DEATH LIKE THAT
644_ben_goertzel|I'M IN THE YONIN SOME SENSE A YOUNG CHILD
644_manolis_kellis|EVENTUALLY ANDVIRMENT CHANGES
644_richard_karp|ON A SET OF LINEAR IN EQUALITIES INVOLVING INTO YOUR VARIABLES
644_steven_pressfield|I HEVE TO BE A BIT OF A WARRIOR TO BE A WRITER
645_dileep_george|BATE A JIST MAT ALGERDON BUT T IT'S T HA YEAR SINCE THE BRAIN DOES SOMETHING LIKE THIS HAS TO THEREIS NO WAY
645_grant_sanderson|I THINK THE REASON I
645_jitendra_malik|HAD SOME INDELIGENCE
645_joscha_bach|PUT YOU IN A CERTAIN WAY TO YOU RELATE TO THENVIROMEN AND TO YOURSELF
645_manolis_kellis|SO THE BETTER A LEAL WHICH WAS THE FAT STORING A LEAL BECAME THE WORSE A LEAL
645_matt_botvinick|FOR A FEW YEARS NOW ABOUT
645_peter_singer|WHERE ALL SUCH IST HUMAN AND MORTAL DO YOU PONDER YOUR OWN MORTALITY
645_sheldon_solomon|AND NAT HAS SPARED YOU THE EXISTANTIAL EXCRUCIATIONS THAT WOULD OTHERWISE ARISE BUT THAT'S LIKE FROUD
646_ben_goertzel|APPROPRIATE STRUCTURES FOR PROCESSING ASPECTS TO TH PHYSICAL AND SOCIAL WORLD
646_dileep_george|AROUND IT IN THE SENSE OF SAYING THAT YOU DO HAVE TO ARE JUST THE
646_grant_sanderson|DID THAT WAS THIS THOUGHT THAT A TON OF PEOPLE ARE LOOKING TO LEARN REMOTELY
646_richard_karp|AND IT WAS NOT DIFFICULT TO SHOW
646_steven_pressfield|A WOULD HE THINK MAKES A WARRIOR AS A TA AS A WARRIOR BORN OR TRAINED
647_ian_hutchinson|RATHER DIFFICULT TO BEAR FROM MY POINT OF VIEW IM
647_joscha_bach|STORY FOR YOUR LIFE AND MAKE PLANS
647_matt_botvinick|OR SO
647_russ_tedrake|AREN'T THE HEAVYIT SO
647_sheldon_solomon|OR YOU DISAGREE WITH ME
647_steven_pressfield|CHILD YOUR TWO YEAR OLD CHILD IS UNDERNEATH  A
648_dileep_george|HARIWE OF A DISTINCT
648_grant_sanderson|I YOU'RE LOOKINGFOR A PLACE TO POINT YOUR STUDENTSIF YOUARE STUDENT LOOK FOR A PLACE TO BE EDIFIED ABOUTMAT
648_joscha_bach|BECAUSE THEY ALTIMATE COURTS
648_manolis_kellis|SO IF YOUL'LK AT MY GENO SPEAKING OF MOM CALLING MAM GAVE ME A BAD COPY OF THAT JEN THESE EFTIO LOCKES
648_matt_botvinick|WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO MAKE THE WORLD THE BETTER PLACE I THINK
648_russ_tedrake|WE ALWAYS KNEW THAT IF WE FELL BACK IF WE GOT TO THE POINT WHERE IF FOR SOME REASON
648_steven_pressfield|CAR'S COMING ON THE STREET THE MOTHER'S A GOING TO LIKE STOP A BEWIC IN OWITH HER BARE HANDS
649_ben_goertzel|MATHEMATICS LIKE SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY DIMENSIONS IN THE YOUNG CHILD
649_françois_chollet|A CONCIABITES
649_ian_hutchinson|YES WHEN THE HEBREWS ARE
649_jitendra_malik|E YOU KNO PEOPLE TALK ABOUT LUCI BECAUSE THAT'S LIKE A SKELETON FROM THREE MILLION YEARS AGO AND WE KNOW THAT LUCI WALKED
649_joscha_bach|AR DIFFEREND AND V CO OPERATE BASTE ON SHAIRED PURPOSE EVERYTHING ELSE THAT DOES NOT CO OPERATION ON CHAIED PURPOSE IS TRANSACTION OR
649_peter_singer|I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANYTHING AFTER
650_dileep_george|APBID PROPERDIS LOCALLY
650_matt_botvinick|AND SO HOW DO YOU MAKE LIFE BETTER FOR HUMANS THAT'S
650_russ_tedrake|HARROWING SORT OF EDGEWER LEDGEWEARY SORT OF ON
650_sara_seager|IT'S LIKE WOU THAT IS INSANE AND THE TEAM BROKE THAT DOWN ACTUALLY INTO A SENSING PROBLEM
650_steven_pressfield|THIS CHILD THIS NEW CREATION THAT THEY ARE BRINGING FORTH
651_ben_goertzel|GRON WHAT PIAZEC CALLED THE
651_dileep_george|IN DAMSOV
651_ian_hutchinson|INITIALLY THEY THOUGHT ABOUT HIM AS
651_matt_botvinick|THAT'S A PROPOSITION THAT
651_peter_singer|OF THE OURABILITY TO BE COGNIZANT OF OUR MORTALITY
651_russ_tedrake|I MEAN ACTUALLY LIKE THE THE FOUR HUNDRED POUND HUMOR I COAND COME CRASHING TO THE GROUND IF YOU IF YOU IF YOUR SOLVER'S NOT FASTENOUGH
652_ben_goertzel|SO THAT THERE IS BOTH MORE SPECIALIZATION
652_manolis_kellis|IT WAS AN OUSTOMOLIAL TO HAVE
652_matt_botvinick|CAREFULLY AND HONESTLY
652_peter_singer|YOU HAVE ANY OF THOSE ELEMENTS IN YOUR DRIVING YOUR MORIVATIAN LIFE
652_richard_karp|AH AND NOW
652_sheldon_solomon|IT FEELS THERE'S THIS FEELING LIKE YOU'RE BASICALLY DROUTING
653_dileep_george|HOW AH HOW MANY JECTS WERE BOSTANSE INTO THE WHOLE THING
653_grant_sanderson|ONE HUNDRED PER CENT ONLINE TEACHING IS BASICALLY A FORM OF LIVESDREAMING NOW
653_ian_hutchinson|AND SO BUT AND AND YET FROM
653_manolis_kellis|RIGHT NOW IT'S PRETTY TERRIBLE ILIA SO THE OTHER CONCEPT IS THAT DIVERSITY MATTERS
653_matt_botvinick|RATHER HARENDOUSLY COMPLICATED ESPECIALLY WHEN
653_sara_seager|EVEN TOUH ITS LOOKING AT A STAR
654_françois_chollet|A GENERAL IN THE STRONG SENSE DOES NOT MEAN HUMANITATIONS CAN CAN BE APPLIED TO ANY PROBLEM
654_ian_hutchinson|YOU KNOW EARLY ON IN HEBREW HISTORY
654_jitendra_malik|BUT AFTER THAT AFTER THAT BECAUSE NO AVES HAVE IMEAN
654_matt_botvinick|THE AAI SYSTEMS THAT EURE
654_richard_karp|CAN WE REDUCE THE PROPOSITIONAL LOGIC PROBLEM TO
654_russ_tedrake|ABOUT THE IDEA OF HARD WORK
654_sara_seager|LIGHT FROM HER OWN SON
655_ben_goertzel|AT THE YOUNG GH I GUESS THASARE IT'S ONE WAY TO BERDYOF KIT
655_grant_sanderson|IF TEACHERS VIEW WHAT THEY'RE DOING IS A KIND OF PERFORMANCE AND A KIND OF LIVESDREAM PERFORMANCE UM
655_joscha_bach|AND THIS NIVO NETWURK IS MAKING ITSELF KNOWN TO THE SYMBOLIC PARTS OF YOUR MIND
655_manolis_kellis|BECAUSE WE ARE SO DIVERSE IN MENOLOGICALLY
655_russ_tedrake|SO IM
655_steven_pressfield|AND THEREBY SACRIFICING E YOU KNOW A BEING LESS EFFECTIVE THAN HE COULD BE
656_dileep_george|ENOUGH TO ON THE LEARNING SIDE
656_grant_sanderson|THAT WOULD PROBABLY BE PRETTY HEALTHY BECAUSE ZOOM CAN BE KAND OF AWKWARD
656_ian_hutchinson|AME TO EAN OR
656_jitendra_malik|PRIMATES OTHER PRIMATES DON'T HAVE THAT BUT SO HE DEVILOPED SOMEWHERE IN THIS ERA BUT A DEVILOP A
656_manolis_kellis|WE ARE LIKELY TO BE VERY RESILIANT
656_peter_singer|I THINK THE MEANING OF LIFE IS THE MEANING WE GIVE TO IT I DON'T THINK THAT
656_sheldon_solomon|AND  SO EMMEANT AT THAT IN THAT SENSE IT FEELS LIKE KEE
657_ben_goertzel|GIMIN AMU IMAN THEIR CUTE THEIR CUTE YEA WHICH IS WHICH IS WILE WE POD WITH THEIR AND REPETIVN ASSENENTENE STUPIDITY BUT THER
657_dileep_george|OR ENOUGH TO SAY
657_grant_sanderson|DD I WROTE UP THIS LITTLE BOGPOST ACTUALLY GUST DONLA
657_jitendra_malik|AND HANDS FREE MUCH BIGGER BRAINSIZE
657_peter_singer|WE WERE BROUGHT INTO THE UNIVERSE
657_richard_karp|CLAUSES EACH OF WHICH IS
657_russ_tedrake|AND RHOBATICS PEOPLE IN GENERAL
657_sheldon_solomon|I MEAN A
657_steven_pressfield|HARD WORK AND
658_ben_goertzel|AND THEY HAVE WHAT THE ZANGEIS WILL CALL A A BEGINER'S MIND WHICH IS A BEAUTIFUL THING BUT THAT DOESN'T NECESSARILY
658_dileep_george|THAT IS DEFINITELY NOT OF ARE
658_françois_chollet|ABSOLUTELY A SO CONSTRAINTOUS PERENT TERENITU OF THY FITS THAT DOESN'T MEAN YOU CAN DO A
658_ian_hutchinson|WAS THAT HE WASN'T JUST A TRIBAL DEITY HE WAS THE
658_jitendra_malik|Y A SOL E BE B  OF THOSE
658_joscha_bach|A VERY OBVIOUS CEAT IF YOURE
658_manolis_kellis|MESSING WITH THE MAKE UP OF VIRUSES OR A
658_richard_karp|A M
658_russ_tedrake|THEY A THEY HAVE
659_françois_chollet|DEFINE AND MEASURE OF PHYSICOL FITNESS
659_ian_hutchinson|GOD THAT CREATED THE WHOLE THING
659_peter_singer|BUT GIVEN THAT WE EXIST I THINK WE CAN RECOGNIZE THAT SOME THINGS ARE
659_steven_pressfield|THERE WAS A PERIOD OF MY LIFE WHEN I WAS JUST A
660_dileep_george|IT'S MUCH EASIER TO DO EXPERIMENTS BECAUSE HE  RAT STAKE OH GE IT IS A STIMULUS
660_joscha_bach|AND IT'S VERY INTUITIVE TO BE INCORTED LIKE THIS
660_peter_singer|OBJECTIVELY
660_richard_karp|THE AN INSITANCE OF THE PROVOSTIONALOLOGIC PROBLEM
660_sara_seager|WHAT MATERIALS CAN U SO THERE'S A SERIES OF PROBLEMS LIKE THAT SO AFSO TE AN MATERIALS PROBLEMIN ER SOME OF THEM
661_jitendra_malik|ARE THEY HAD SPECIAL INDILIGENCE
661_manolis_kellis|HUMANS ARE MUCH DUMBER
661_matt_botvinick|DOING THINGS THAT HARM HUMANS ADI MEAN I HASTEN TO SAY
661_sara_seager|AND THERE'S ONE SO WE SOCU ALMOST FINISH SOLVING ALL THOSE PROBLEMS AND THEN IT'S JUST A MATTER OF
661_sheldon_solomon|A EVEN ANY KIND OF THOUGHT EXPERIMENT YE LET'S US FORGET NA DENAL DAT LIKE A
661_steven_pressfield|ICANTO THINK OF IT SOR LIKE AN ATHLEE DOES I'M SURE THAT LIKE STEFF CURRY
662_grant_sanderson|AND IT TOOK A LITTLE BIT OF PRACTICE AND I WOULD MESS IT UP
662_ian_hutchinson|IN A WAY THE MOST AMAZING
662_jitendra_malik|AINTERACTIONS AMONG OBJECTS THEY COULD MOVE IN SPACE SO THEY HAD SPACE AND TIME AND ALL OF THAT SO
662_manolis_kellis|IF YOU WERE TO CREATE
662_matt_botvinick|I CONSIDER THOSE HUGELY IMPORTANT ISSUES AND
662_russ_tedrake|THAT WE WORK HARD
662_sheldon_solomon|OTHERS THERE'S NO COMMUNITY OF PEOPLE
662_steven_pressfield|SO I DO THINK I'M FROM THAT KIND OF T A HEALTH SCHOOL THE GOOD THING ABOUT BEIN A WRITER
663_dileep_george|WHAT ARE THESE IDEAS BEYOND RECURSE OF CORDICAL NETWORK THAT A YOU ARE LOOKING AT NOW Y
663_grant_sanderson|NOW AND THEN BUT I HINK I ADDED
663_manolis_kellis|AH YOU KNOW VIRUS LIKE SARS
663_russ_tedrake|I THINK OTHER DISCIPLINES WORK VERY HARD TOO BUT I'S I DON'T THINK IT'S
663_sheldon_solomon|PE LIKE IMAGINE IF IT IS LIKE IMAGINE THEARTH IS FLAT LIKE THINK ABOUT IT RI AT A LOT OF PEOPLE JUST LIKE NOL THE EARTH IS WRONG TH
664_ben_goertzel|TO THE SPECIFIC GULLS THAT HUMANS NEED TO ACHIEVE
664_dileep_george|SIR WE HAVE MADE A INO PASS THROUGH OR MINOMATAPLE OF THE STEPS THAT EINASE AS I MENTIONED
664_françois_chollet|A OF CRIGNITY ABIDITIS RIGHT AND
664_grant_sanderson|ECENTLY SMOOTHED SUCH THAT
664_matt_botvinick|COMMUNITY AT DEEP MIND AND OF COURSE ELSEWHERE WHO ARE DEDICATED TO THINKING
664_sara_seager|STHIS IS THE NEEGYIN CLOSE ENGINE YET IT WAS AN ENGINEERING PROJECT IT'S AL ENGIN YOUR PROJECT
665_françois_chollet|AT THE TOP OF THE AHIARCHY OF PHYSICAL ABILITIES THAT Y WOULD BE ABLE TO OBSERVE HE WOULD HAVE A
665_grant_sanderson|AND I'M TALKING TO THE CAMERON THEN WE'RE DOING SOMETHING ON THE PAPER THAN WE'RE DOING LIKE A UM
665_jitendra_malik|PERCEPTION AND ACTION IN THE WORLD WE LIVE
665_joscha_bach|AND YOU TELL HER THE TRUTH
665_richard_karp|IN THE SATISFIABILITY PROBLEM IS WHETHER THOSE CLAUSES CAN BE SIMULTANEOUSLY SATISFIED
665_sheldon_solomon|LIKE THOUHT ABOT LIKE IMAGINE LIKE IS  THOUGT EXPERIMENT
666_dileep_george|FROM THE ANGLE OF COGNITION RAT IT WAS NOT JUST PERCEPTION FOR PERCEPTION'S SAKE
666_françois_chollet|A  AMAFULOGI
666_grant_sanderson|PLAYING WITH A DESMOSCRAFT FOR SOMETHING AND SOMETHING THAT I THINK IN THE PAST WOULD HAVE REQUIRED A PRODUCTION TEAM YOU CAN ACTUALLY DO AS A SOLLOW OPERATION
666_matt_botvinick|BUT THERE'S A THERE'S I GUESS I GUESS I WOULD SAY POSITIVE SIDE TO THIS TOO WHICH IS TO SAY WELL
666_peter_singer|LEASE CONSIDER SUPPORTING THE POTCASS BY DOMLOTING CASH HAP AND USE THE CODE LEX POKCAS
666_sheldon_solomon|A A EVIDENCE
667_dileep_george|SO WE HAVE A TAKEN ONE POSTERATE RISK U SYING WHAT IS THE BASIC COLNICATIVE ARCHITECTURE
667_ian_hutchinson|EN I KIND OF BARM
667_joscha_bach|
667_manolis_kellis|OR AT LEAST SOME RELATIVE OF SARS THE SOURCE GENOM FOR THE CURRENT VIRUS WAS SOMETHING COMPLETELY DIFFERENT
667_matt_botvinick|WHAT WOULD IT MEAN TO MAKE HUMAN LIFE BETTER
667_richard_karp|WHICH IS GOING TO BE GIVEN THE
667_steven_pressfield|THE WHEN YOU STORPE AGAIN TO CERTAIN DISCIPLINES LIKE WILAMOSKUE AND ME F ENGENEERING DISCIPLINES
668_ben_goertzel|HARD WHERE RESOURCES WERE BRING TO BEAR
668_jitendra_malik|TOURING IN HIS A MENTION OF
668_joscha_bach|SO Y INSTEAD DIESNE A
668_matt_botvinick|AND HOW HOW CAN WE IMAGINE LEARNING SYSTEMS
669_ben_goertzel|AR VERY DIFFERENT THAN THE HUMAN BRAIN
669_dileep_george|SMETHING LIKE A
669_françois_chollet|AH OF A DEGREE OF GENERIT THAT IS ABSOLUTE  REMARKABLE
669_joscha_bach|'S WRONG YOU SHOULD FOLLOW YOUR HEART
669_matt_botvinick|I AND AND IN TALKING TO MY COLLEAGUES ABOUT THAT WE REACHED THE
669_russ_tedrake|I MEAN IT REALLY DID TEACH ME
669_steven_pressfield|NON MUSE TIME MEANIT RIGHT RIGHTS O
670_dileep_george|ROUTINE PROGLAME LEARNING SYSTEM ON TOP OF IT
670_jitendra_malik|OF INTELLIGENCE AEU WHAT WOULD IMPRESS THE HECK OUT OF YOU IS IT
670_manolis_kellis|NO SPECIES OF WHICH HAS EVER INFECTED HUMANS IN THAT BRANCH
671_jitendra_malik|FUNDAMENTALLY NATURAL LANGUAGE OR IS THERE SOMETHING IN VISION
671_joscha_bach|UT HAPPINESS ITSELF IS NOT IMPORTANT HAPPINESS IS LIKE A KOKI
671_peter_singer|SUPPORT ON PATRION
671_richard_karp|AND YOU WANT TOO
671_russ_tedrake|REALLY EM WAT'S FOUNDATIONAL IN MY THINKING I THINK THE ATONOMOUS DRIVING COMMUNITY THINKS ABOUT THIS I THINK LOTS OF
671_sara_seager|AND THEN AF I COULD SINK SIN
671_sheldon_solomon|APUBLISHER WHO OF
672_ben_goertzel|IN A VAT THAT I COULD REWAR ARBITRARILY
672_françois_chollet|IN THE HUMAN CONDITION IT
672_grant_sanderson|AND IF WE TAKE LESSONS THAT ARE USUALLY DONE IN THESE ONE OFFSETTINGS AND LIKE START TO GET IN THE HABIT OF
672_peter_singer|O CONNECTED ME ON TWITTEELEX FRIEDMAN SPELL
672_russ_tedrake|PEOPLE THINKING ABOUT SAFETY CRITICAL SYSTEMS THAT MIGHT HAVE MACHINE LEARNING IN THE LOOP
673_ian_hutchinson|A AND THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS YOU KNOW
673_joscha_bach|NOT BEING HAPPY ENOUGH SO THEY FIXD THIS RIGHT THEY CAN RELEASE IN YOUR TRANSMITTERS AT WILL IF THEY TRAIN
673_manolis_kellis|THE LIKELY YET THAT THE PATH TO ENGINEERING A DEADLY VIRS WOULD NOT COME FROME THIS
673_matt_botvinick|AM N AN SO HUMAN AGENT INTERACTION HAS BECOME A YOU KNOW A QUITE
673_peter_singer|JUST AFAR I D A MAAN
673_richard_karp|THE COMPLIMENT OF A TRUE IN SOME OTHER CLUS
673_russ_tedrake|ARE THINKING ABOUT THESE QUESTIONS FOR ME
673_sara_seager|I I AND THEN AN THEY GET THE ACTAN MAKI WORK A IF YOU GET STARSHIDE INFORMATION
674_ben_goertzel|AN SA A MODERN SURFERFARM OF CPUS IN G PUS WHICH IN TURN MAY BE QUITE DIFFERENT IN THE WAY I WOULD WANT TO IMPLEMENT A G I

678_grant_sanderson|LE LITERALLY MILLIONS OF TIMES  BY DIFFERENT PEOPLE
678_sheldon_solomon|HART OF IT I THINK AGAIN IF THESE IDEAS
679_ben_goertzel|YOU WON'T NECESSARILY WANT THE SAME ALGARITHMS THAT YOU WANT THAT YOU WANT ON I ON THE HUMAN BRAIN AND YU KNOW FROM THE RIGHT LEVEL OF ABSTRACTION
679_ian_hutchinson|OR FRIEND OR YOUR
679_joscha_bach|THE KNIFE IS THE CELL
679_manolis_kellis|YOU KNOW BODDLE OR SOMETHING
679_matt_botvinick|THAT WILL EVENTULE HAVE TO INTERACT WITH HUMANS THEE INTERACTION ITSELF HAS TO BE BECOME
679_sara_seager|AS THE GRAVITATION LENTS
680_dileep_george|THAT YE CAN MANIPULATE IN YOUR HEAD
680_grant_sanderson|AH THAT EXIST SO THAT WHEN SOMEONE NEEDS THAT EXPLANATION THEY CAN GO TO IT
680_ian_hutchinson|OR YOUR COLLEAGUE OR OR OR WHOEVER IT IU A FAMILY MEMBER OR WHOEVER IT MIGHT BE AHM AND THAT'S THE ONLY REALLY
680_jitendra_malik|WAS TRYING TO SOLVE A SETIN PROBLEM
680_manolis_kellis|UT IT'S NOT LIKE A CH V WHICH CAN STAY DORMAN FOR A LONG TIME BITSKI KORAN OF IRICE IS JUST DON'T DO THAT THEY ARE NODTING TO GRATING GENUMS THERE ARE ANAGI NUPS SIF IT'S NOT EXPRESSED
680_richard_karp|TO SOMETHING CALLED THE INDEPENDENT SAT PROBLEM WHERE YOU ARE JUST SORT OF ASKING FOR
681_dileep_george|FROM IS IN A SET OF IMAGES OF INPUT AND OUTPUT
681_ian_hutchinson|SENSE IN WHICH WE CAN GIVE COMFORT IF WE TRY TO GIVE INTELLECTUAL
681_manolis_kellis|IT DEGRADES OUR INADE DEGRADES IT DOESN'T A STICKER ON
681_richard_karp|A A SET OF VERTISEAS IN AGRAPH SUCH THAT NO TWO OF THEM AR ADJACENT SORT OF THE OPPOSITE OF THE CLEAQ PROBLEM
682_ben_goertzel|PROCESSES BUT YOU KNOW FINDING THAT LEVEL OF ABSTRACTION IS ITS OWN A G R RESEARCH PROPER PROJECT EN R SO
682_grant_sanderson|SO IF DURING A PENDEMIC YOU CAN HAVE PEOPLE
682_ian_hutchinson|SOLUTIONS TO THESE

685_manolis_kellis|PEOPLE WITH LESS VACCINATION HAVE BEEN DYING MORE
685_sara_seager|MICRELENSINE EVENTS
686_ben_goertzel|EMBODIED COMMUNICATION PRIOR WHICH
686_dileep_george|AAR JUST LEARNED FROM PEXT
686_grant_sanderson|A PIECE THAT WAS ALWAYS GOING TO BE PUBLICIZED TO MORE PEOPLE THAN JUST YOUR STUDENTS THAT CAN BE REALLY POWERFUL
686_ian_hutchinson|I AND AFTER ALL
686_matt_botvinick|BETHOVENSONADAS

687_sara_seager|AS AN UNSEEN GRAVITATIONAL LENSAR PASSES IN BETWEEN US AND THAT VERY DISTANT STAR
687_sheldon_solomon|A POGAT REALLY HIGH
687_steven_pressfield|A BIG ACCOMPLISHMENT OF THE DAY A THE SAME TIME IT'S NOT LIKE SO HARD THAT I'M COMPLETELY EXHAUSTED YOU KNOW I'M
688_ben_goertzel|CONSCIOUSNESS IN IT BECAUSE TO ME THE QUEL YOR PROBLEM AN SUBJECTIVE EXPERIENCE
688_joscha_bach|OD FEELS MOST MEANINGFILL TO ME AS TO TRY TO BUILD AND MAINTAIN
688_sara_seager|S ACTUALLY REAL TOOL AN ASTRONOMY
689_ben_goertzel|IS VERY INTERESTING ISSUE ALSO WHICH WHICH WE CAN CHAT ABOUT EBUT I WOULD RATHER
689_françois_chollet|CIBICALLY WE'D HAVE
689_grant_sanderson|PUTTING OUT SOME CONTENT
689_jitendra_malik|SEEN UNDERSTANDING
689_joscha_bach|SUSTAINABLE CIVILIZATION
689_steven_pressfield|CORRESPOND AND T STUFF HAS TO BE DONE AND AN I WORK OR MAYBE
690_grant_sanderson|AND LIKE NOBODY
690_ian_hutchinson|THAT IS TO SAY HE HAS SUFFERED WITH US

692_jitendra_malik|SO ULTIMATELY LIKE WE SAID VISION THAT AIDS IN THE ACTION IN A SURVIVAL IN THIS WORLD YE
692_joscha_bach|PERHAPS MUST HAVE PLANTED THE SEED THE INITIAL SEED OF THE CELL
692_matt_botvinick|WELL EVEN IF WE KNEW THE ANSWER TO THAT
693_dileep_george|THE LOVLEVEL KIND OF MAKES IT FILECOKE THAT'S THE INBLICAN UNIMPORTUNATE LEG IT MORT LEK AH
693_françois_chollet|AND WHICH YOU YOU WOULD NEED TO RECOGNIZE OR PRODUCE THE CRANSPUNNING OUTPUT AND

693_russ_tedrake|SO IF YOU
693_sara_seager|CL BE A HUNDRED PICTLES WHICH WOULD BE AWESOME
694_ben_goertzel|I AM NOT SIR HE
694_dileep_george|IN THE VISHEL AN DE MOTOR SYSTEM ANDER INODER THE A

695_dileep_george|THE CONCEPT LEARNING SYSTEM WHICH IF YOU CUT OFF THE LANGUAGE BUT JUST THE JUST WHAT WE LEARN BY INTRACTING WITH THE WORLD AND ABSTRACTIONS FROM THAT
695_grant_sanderson|COUPLE WEEKS AGO HE AR HE TEACHES THIS COURSE AND UNDERACTUATED ROBOTICS WHICH IS A
695_jitendra_malik|OPEN PROBLEMS OF MATHEMATICS SOME OF WHICH ARE STILL INSOLVED MOST IMPORTANT FAMOUS OF WHICH IS PROBABLY THE REMAN HYPOTHESIS
695_manolis_kellis|EXERCISE AND
695_sara_seager|CRAZY RIGHT AND IT'S CRAZY FOR A LOT OF OTHER REASONS BECAUSE AGAIN YOU HAVE TO LINE UP THE SUN AND YOUR TARGET YOU'D ONLY HAVE ONE TELESCOPE PER TARGE
695_steven_pressfield|LIKE YOU SAIT FACING THE WALL
696_joscha_bach|HYPOTHESIS AND WITH MY INTUITION THAT ALRBEO JENESIS IS VERY UNLIKELY
696_steven_pressfield|WHAT'S D'E HAVE LITTLE RITUAL ME LIKE THE GRANULER ASPECT OF REGULAR ASPECTS A
697_ben_goertzel|MOVING AROUND IN A WORLD THAT'S COMPOSED
697_françois_chollet|THERE IS IN A ALIBIT MODERNISATION BUT IT REMAINS THAT
697_matt_botvinick|EVEN THAT BECOMES COMPLICATED BE WHAT IF WHAT IF TWO A WHAT IF TWO HUMANS WANT DIFFERENT THINGS
697_sheldon_solomon|A FEW THANKS ON

698_jitendra_malik|UNDERSTAND OU THE BEHAVIOR IN THERE INTEMS OF AGENTS
698_manolis_kellis|AND ONE OF THE STUDIES WERE DOING NOW IS BASICALY LOOKING AT WHAT ARE THE EFFECTS OF DIET AND EXERCISE HOW SIMILAR ARE THEY TO EACH OTHER
698_steven_pressfield|THE ONE THING
699_jitendra_malik|THEIR GAUL'S INTENTIONALITY
699_manolis_kellis|REBITICALLY TAKEN
699_matt_botvinick|IPGOES BEYOND
699_richard_karp|WHICH MEAN THAT YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO CHOOSE
699_sheldon_solomon|I THINK A CASE COULD BE MADE THAT HUMANS ARE
700_dileep_george|I THINK OF PERCIPTIONOUS KIND OF
700_ian_hutchinson|ABSOLUTELY CRUCIAL PART OF IT
700_jitendra_malik|AND I MAKE PREDICTIONS ABOUT WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN
700_manolis_kellis|BOTH THE STROMOSELES AND THE MUNSELES OF EACH OF THE TICIES RESPONDING TOO
700_matt_botvinick|QUESTIONS OF ENGINEERING A TECHNOLOGY AND
700_richard_karp|AN BOTH ENDS OF THE EDGE EITHER BECAUSE THEY ARE IN THE SAME CLAWS ARE THERE
700_russ_tedrake|MAYBE THAT'S ALL WILL EVER BE ABLE TO BUT I THINK A
700_steven_pressfield|WHEN I SIT DOWN I IMMEDIATELY GET INTO IT FIRST SECOND DEA
701_dileep_george|HE  THE PRO THE FUS
701_grant_sanderson|I MEAN  IS THERE SOMETHING YOUWIL RECOMMEND TERMS OF EQUIPMENT THAT IS A DURECT YOU THINK LIKE LAPALMIKE'S

704_manolis_kellis|WHICH BASICLY RECONFIGURE THOSE RECEPTOR CELLS
704_matt_botvinick|I ACTUALLY FELT
705_jitendra_malik|AND YET HAVE SOME KIND OF MODEL OF THEIR BEHAVIOR CR
705_manolis_kellis|WITH THE EFFECT OF EXERCISE
705_richard_karp|ALGRETMS THAT THEY'ARE ALL SOMEHOW RELATED HERE I I KNOW IT CAN BE PROVEN
705_russ_tedrake|THE ROBART
705_steven_pressfield|IT'S ALSO CERTA BOUNCING BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN HA DIFFERENT BETWEEN THE RIGHT BRAN AND THE LEFT RAN KING TO LOOKING AT IT AND
706_ben_goertzel|STARTING FROM THAT YOU'RE STARTING TOGETHER REQUIREMENTS AN ALYSIS FOR FOR FOR HUMAN HUMAN LEVEL
706_dileep_george|WHEN PERCEPTION COGNITION LANGUAGE ALL DOSE THINGS WORKE TOGETHER FINALLY
706_joscha_bach|AT ITS ANAUTOMATA
706_matt_botvinick|THIS BUILDING THIS KIND OF STAFF IS GOING TO LEAD US
706_sara_seager|LAUNCHED INTO
706_steven_pressfield|THE NIGHT BEFORE OF WHAT THAT STARTING POINT IS I ALWAYS TRY TO STOP
707_jitendra_malik|CASTODESIS THIS IS VONALIA THEN LE A WE TALK ABOUT TE UNDERSTANDING THE WORLD ENTREATI
707_matt_botvinick|BACK TO ASKING REALLY FUNDAMENTAL QUESTIONS ABOUT

707_sheldon_solomon|WELL INTENTIONED DILA TOM IN THIS IN AN NISREGARD TAT BECAUSE WHAT
708_ian_hutchinson|YOU'VE GOT TO SHOW THAT THERE IS A WAY IN WHICH YOU COULD INVENT A WORLD THAT IS BETTER
708_manolis_kellis|THE EFFECT ON YOUR LIVER ARE YOUR DIGESTIVE SYSTEM
708_russ_tedrake|THE POWER EFFECTIVELY WENT OUT ON THE ROBOT
708_sara_seager|HAT'S A FEW METERS IN DIAMETER
708_steven_pressfield|AS I WACTUALLY ON WALKS SOMETIMES THINGS POPPING YOUR HEAD YOU KNOW YOU GO OH I SHOULD CHANGE THAT TO
709_ben_goertzel|AND THIS THIS AS
709_ian_hutchinson|AVAN

709_richard_karp|ANY ONE OF THEIR MEN
709_steven_pressfield|UT THAT'S NOT YOUR EGO DOING IT THAT'S
710_ben_goertzel|MATURED OVER THE LEST DECADES AND I GOT INTO THIS LATIN
710_dileep_george|AND THEN ASK YOU A QUESTION FALLING THAT SENTENCE THIS YO SAY NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSIN PROBLEM RIGT I'LL ASSA SO HEDE GUS I AM TELLING YOU
710_françois_chollet|A PROTECT AGAINST THE CORRECT ANSWERS

710_manolis_kellis|ARIPOZ YOU KNOW THE MOST MISUNDERSTOOD ORGAN EVERYBODY THINKS FAT
710_matt_botvinick|FORCE US BACK TO
710_russ_tedrake|BUT FOR OURS SO THE HARDEST PART OF THE CHALLENGE THE HARDEST TASK IN MY VIEW WAS GETTING OUT OF THE POLARUS
711_ben_goertzel|SO AFTER DRINGING MY PEAGI IN MATH I WAS AN ACADEMIC FOR EIGHT YEARS I WAS IN DEPARTMENTS OF
711_ian_hutchinson|SO I DONT THINK SI SIRVIRE AND NFILSAFGOR
711_joscha_bach|EING THAT WE ARE PART OF
711_manolis_kellis|TERRIBLE NO FAT IS ALSOME YOUR FAT SAILS IS WITH KEEPING YOU ALIVE
711_matt_botvinick|HINKING ABOUT THINKING  YOU KNOW AND IT MIGHT RING IT MIGHT BRING IT MIGHT RESTORE A CERTAIN I DON'T KNOW A CERTAIN DEPTH TO T
711_sara_seager|TELESCOPES WITH LAZERS
711_sheldon_solomon|LONG BEFORE
711_steven_pressfield|MYBE MAYBE I'LL READ SOMETHING NOTHING HEAVY
712_dileep_george|QE  THAT'S A SENTENCE NOW I'M ASKING YOUR A QUESTION WHA'S THE NAIL HORIZONTAL ORWORTHY
712_matt_botvinick|OR OR EVEN DARE I SAY SPIRITUALITY TO
712_russ_tedrake|AND THATHEY ALSO PROVIDED THE VEHICLE WHICH IS A LITTLE POLLERUS AND
712_steven_pressfield|ANA I GO TO BED PRETTY EARLY AND I'M
713_dileep_george|QA HOW DID YOU ANSWER THAT
713_jitendra_malik|AND THESE TECHNIQUES ARE BAST ON
713_joscha_bach|ITS THE SING IN WHICH WE HAVE A SIMILAR RELATIONSHIP AS THE CELL HAS TO OUR BODY
713_matt_botvinick|YE KOW THA THE THE USUAL THE USUAL SCHEMEA FOR THINKING ABOUT AM
713_russ_tedrake|THE ROBAT DIDN'T REALLY FIT IN THE CAR SO YOU COULDN'T DRIVE THE CAR WITH YOUR FEET
713_sara_seager|D THESE LAZERS WOULD MOMENTARILY
713_steven_pressfield|AND GETTING MYSELF
714_ben_goertzel|COGNIV PSYCHOLOGY
714_dileep_george|T IS NOT IN YOUR LANGUID SISTER
714_françois_chollet|BECAUSE THE AMBIGUITY
714_grant_sanderson|SOMETHING THAT I DO TO BE OUT THERE TO SHOW LIKE KE THIS IS WHAT IS LIKE ROTH IS WHAT IS LIKE WHAN I MAKE MISTAKES AM THIS IS LIKE THE PACE OF THINKING AM
714_ian_hutchinson|PERCEPTION FROM PERFECTION FROM WHICH WE HAVE FALLEN
714_manolis_kellis|FAT BURNING IN MANY WAYS
714_russ_tedrake|BUT THE HARD PART WAS WE HAD TO THEN PARK THE CAR GET OUT OF THE CAR
714_sara_seager|CHINA WORTS
714_steven_pressfield|SYKE UP FOR THAT
715_ben_goertzel|YOU CAN SEE
715_ian_hutchinson|I THINK THERE IS A PERFECTION FROM WHICH WE FALLEN BUT I DON'T THINK THAT PERFECTION IS SOME KIND OF PHYSICAL
715_jitendra_malik|AND THEYRE BASED ON HAVING AT TRAINING TIME THREEDY MODELS OF OBJECTS OVER THE
715_manolis_kellis|YOU KNOW AGAINWHEN YOU DON'T HAVE THE HOMOSAGES VERSION THAT I HAVE
715_matt_botvinick|TOTALLY ON BOARD FOR THAT BUT THEREIS A
715_richard_karp|AS A WORD IS ENPY COMPLETENESS AN ENPY HARD
715_steven_pressfield|AND THEN I WAS CONK OUT LIKE A LIGHT AND WAKE UP WIT THE CRACK OF DAWN
716_ben_goertzel|THOSE MULTIPLE TYPES OF MEMORY WHICH ARE TO SOME EXTENT
716_joscha_bach|OBASITLY ER THE CHRISTIAN GOD IN ITS NATURAL FORM WITHOUT THE MYTHOLOGY IF YOU'D UNDRESS IT ESPACELY THE PLATONIC FORM OF CIVILIZATION
717_dileep_george|ND BY BY THE AGE OF FAR YOU YOU HAVE PRETTY MUCH ALL OF THIS RIGHT AND
717_manolis_kellis|I SOD AFFLIPPING A MASTER METABULLIC SWITCH
717_russ_tedrake|I REMEMBER AFTER WATCHING THOSE VIDIOSES MUCH MORE COGNIZAN OF HOW HARD IS IT
717_sara_seager|IS SPONSERING
717_steven_pressfield|WHUTDO YOU THINK THE MUSE HAS A STORE FOR YOU AH I DON'T THINK YOU CAN EVER KNOW
718_ben_goertzel|HUMAN BRAIN HAS SUBSTANTIALLY DIFFERENT SUB SYSTEMS FOR THESE DIFFERENT
718_dileep_george|T IS STORED IN YOUR OFVICIALS OF STONE WATER OF THE STOE
718_ian_hutchinson|SO JUST TO BE CLEAR ABOUT THAT IM YOU KNOW I I ON THE OTHER HAND I DO THINK SO
718_joscha_bach|AND WE LEFT WITH
718_matt_botvinick|INFORMATION ABOUT
718_richard_karp|THAT MEANS THAT THE ANSWER IS JUST YES OR NO THE THINK THERE THERE IS A CLEAK OF SIZE FIFTEEN OR THEREIS NOT A CLEAK OF SIZE FIFTEEN
718_russ_tedrake|IT IS FOR ME TO GET IN AND OUT OF THE CAR
719_dileep_george|INEVA SUCH THAT IT CAN BE AXES
719_françois_chollet|O THE KI FEBENOTCHING NUMBER SEQUENCE IF YOU LOOK AT THE FIRST FEW NUMBERS THAT SEQUENCE COULD BE COMPLETED IN A LOT OF DIFFERENT WAYS UM
719_ian_hutchinson|IF THAT'S THE CASE THEN CERTAINLY IN THAT SENSE AT THE VERY LEAST
719_joscha_bach|ONE OF MY FAVOURITE LINES AND THERE'S MANY WHICH IS HAPPINESS
719_sheldon_solomon|THAT IT'S GOOD OR A WAY
720_dileep_george|CONNECTED TO THE M
720_ian_hutchinson|I AM SUFFERING OR AT LEAST DEATH
720_manolis_kellis|THAT YOU COULD GIVE
720_matt_botvinick|THE NARRATIVE THERE IS USUALLY THAT THEY GAIN MORE AND MORE WISDOM
720_sara_seager|IS BROKEN DOWN TO CONCRETE THINGS LIKE ONE OF THEM IS WILL YOU HAVE TO BUY THE LAND AND MAKE SURE THE AIR SPACES O K WITH YOU SENDING UP THAT MUCH POWER OVERHEAD
720_sheldon_solomon|THAT IT AROSE BECAUSE WERE UBER SOCIAL
721_ian_hutchinson|AK IS PART OF
721_sheldon_solomon|CREATURES WHO FROM TIME TO TIME TOOK COMFORT
721_steven_pressfield|I WOULD HAVE BEEN CRAZID IF SAIITO SAI THAT'S OW I JUST HOPE
722_françois_chollet|I AM PESSONER NOT A FANITH ANDBIGUIY
722_ian_hutchinson|BIOLOGICL
722_manolis_kellis|OR S AR
722_richard_karp|SAW WHEN YOU ASKING FOR THEE
723_françois_chollet|I REQUIRE A LOT OF EXTROPOLATION
723_jitendra_malik|AND I HAVE A GUESS OF WHAT IT
723_joscha_bach|AND A PLEASURE TO TALK TO YOU I'M SURE OUR PASS WILL CROSS MANY TIMES AGAIN
723_steven_pressfield|THAT I'M OPEN TO IT YOU KNOW
724_ben_goertzel|INCREMENALLY THROUGH EVOLUTION BECAUSE EACH OF THE
724_françois_chollet|LL VER THE TURING EXAMPLES BUT THE BEAUTIFUL QUESTION
724_grant_sanderson|WHAT THEY DO TWELL I WHAT I THINK
724_jitendra_malik|ETY SHAPE HIS LEKE SO YOUARE ALMOST LEARNING THE CAD MOTTLE
724_joscha_bach|JASA TAKES SO MUCH FOR TALKING TO DAY
724_matt_botvinick|NATURAL HUMAN TRADECTIRES WILL LEAD US TOWARDS PROGRESS
724_richard_karp|AND YOU'RE ASKING FOR THE ONE WITH THE HIGHEST VALUATION THAT'S AN OBSTIMIZATION PROBLEM
724_russ_tedrake|ON THE FIRST DAY OF THE COMPETITION
724_sara_seager|EYLL GO BY THE NEAREST STAR SYSTEM AND SNAP A FEW SNAP SOME IMAGES AND RADIO THE INFORMATION BACK TO EARTH
724_sheldon_solomon|AND THAT THERE IS
725_grant_sanderson|UM EDITED OR SCRIPPTIT OR WHATEVER FORMENT YOU WANT TO DO

728_grant_sanderson|ASMC CHEMISTRY PLASMO PHYSICS REALLY WELL SO HE CAN VERY SIMPLY EXPLAIN SOME
728_ian_hutchinson|AND THE SCARCITY OF THINGS SOMEHOW CREATE
728_joscha_bach|PLEASE CONSIDER SUPPORTING THE POTGAS BY GUINEA EXPRESSIVE PIN AT EXPRESSIVE PNE DA CAM SLASH SLAX SPOD AND

729_dileep_george|IS BUILDING AIR
729_joscha_bach|DOWN LOADING ASH RAP AND USING COAT LEX
729_sara_seager|THAT IS AGAN TO STAY ON THAT THAT IS SO POWERFUL TO TAKE A BIG CRAZY IDEA
730_françois_chollet|BUT IT'S REALLY HARD FOR MACHINES BUT ON THE YOU KNOW
730_ian_hutchinson|YE TRANSHUMANISM DOESN'T LOOK VERY ATTRACTIVE TO ME EITHER
730_jitendra_malik|GUIDING THAT WINE
730_joscha_bach|YOU ENJOY THIS THING
730_manolis_kellis|AN ADETIONAL SOURCE OF VARIATION SO WHEN YOU THINKING ABOUT IT OF PERSONALIZE ANTICINAL ADVICE
730_sara_seager|AND BREAK IT DOWN INTO SMALLER CRAZY IDEAS ORDERD IN A LIST
730_sheldon_solomon|AND CO ORDINATION AND THAT IT WAS ONLY SUBSEQUENTLY
731_françois_chollet|THE DESIGNING AN ACU TUST
731_ian_hutchinson|UT IT ALSO DOESN'T LOOK VERY EASIBLE
731_joscha_bach|SUBSCRIBED ON YOU TO
731_matt_botvinick|TO BRING INTO FOCUS THE QUESTION OF WHAT
732_dileep_george|CONTROLLABLE PORCEPTIAL SYSTEM
732_ian_hutchinson|AM WELL IN THAT'S A WHOLE BIG TOPIC THAT IAM NOT AN EXACTLY AN EXPRESS RALT SAID BUT I BUT
732_manolis_kellis|AND PART OF THAT IS HOW TO WE MATCH YOUR GENETICS
732_matt_botvinick|WHAT IT WOULD LOOK LIKE FOR THINGS TO GO RIGHT
732_richard_karp|RATHER THAN N PE COMPLETE AND MPICOMPLETEST FOR DECISION POWER AN N P COMPLETUST FOR DECISION PROBLEMS
732_russ_tedrake|AND AND BASICALLY THERE WAS WHEN THE RUBBIT WAS IN ONE OF ITS MOST PRECARIOUS
733_dileep_george|ANDER WE BUILD A SCHEM AN ED WORKS WHICH ARE SA CONTROLLABLE DYNAMIC SYSTEM
733_françois_chollet|AND IT WAS AN INTERESTING QUESTION OF WHAT IT TAKES TO CREATE A REALLY HARD
733_jitendra_malik|SO FORSTO ALL I THINK AH
733_manolis_kellis|EAKING OF DIESK ASE I HAVE  WRESTLED IN COMBATSPORTS TO SPORTS MY WHOLE LIFE OR IT WAIGHT MATTERS YOU HAVE TO CUTT IN AL ESO A
733_russ_tedrake|YOU KNOW SORT OF CONFIGURATIONS TRYING TO
733_sara_seager|JUST LIKE THE VISION OF THAT THE SCARY THE THE DARKNESS
733_sheldon_solomon|THAT INCLUDED
733_steven_pressfield|HE PARALLYZED BY FEAR
734_ben_goertzel|WHAT YOU NEEDED TO DO
734_françois_chollet|QUESTIONED FOR HUMANS BECAUSE IAM
734_grant_sanderson|E INNERNETT WOULD BE REPLEIN
734_sara_seager|DON
734_sheldon_solomon|THE HOPE OF SOME KIND OF IMMORTALITY
735_ben_goertzel|WHAT WAS TO
735_dileep_george|US ABSTRACTIONS THAT HE CAN
735_manolis_kellis|ABOUT MY BODY AND
736_grant_sanderson|I MEAN IT'S A
736_jitendra_malik|I THINK THAT ARE SETTINGS WHERE EXPLANABILITY MATTERS
736_joscha_bach|NOW LET ME LEAVE YOU SOME WORDS WISDOM
736_manolis_kellis|IT SEEMS TO BE I THINK TRUE ABOUT THER PEOPLES BODIES IS THAT
736_matt_botvinick|DECEPTION BEING INVOLVED AT WITHOUT MANIPULATION BEING INVOLVED
736_russ_tedrake|TOLD ITS LEFT FOOT TO GO LIKE THIS AND A
736_sheldon_solomon|SO THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE SO O IT SAID
737_dileep_george|IT WILL BE VERY SIMPLE EXAMPLES IN ISIALLY IT WILL NOT BE THE GIPITI THRELIKE EXAMPLES BUT IT WILL BE
737_françois_chollet|WHICH IS A BIG CHALLENGE THAT THIS WILL STILL BE NOVEL FOR YOU
737_jitendra_malik|AND THOSE MIGHT THESE ARE THESE MIGHT BE FOR EXAMPLE QUESTIONS AND MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS
737_matt_botvinick|A EUDO MAXIMIZING HUMAN AUTONOMY
737_russ_tedrake|AND THAT WASN'T GOOD IM BUT BUT IT TURNED DISASTROUS FOR US
737_sheldon_solomon|DAVID SLOANE WILSON WROTE A BOOK CALLED DARWIN'S CATHEDRAL
738_françois_chollet|AS A STUPID STUDENT I CAN STEAL ASTE TUST
738_manolis_kellis|THINGS THAT'S THE MIRACULOUS THING ABOUT THIS BIOLOGICAL SYSTEM ISA
738_richard_karp|IT 'LL DEPEND ON CONCEPTSLITER NOW OUTSIDE THE BOX
738_sheldon_solomon|AND HE SAID RELIGION HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH DEATH IT'S A ITYVOLVED
739_ben_goertzel|YOU CAN'T UNFORTUNATELY WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE DETAILS
739_jitendra_malik|MAYBE THE DOCTOR MAYBE A COMPEROR PROGRAMME HAS MADE US SET IN DIAGNOSIS
739_manolis_kellis|NOT WELL SUITED TO THAT NUTRITIONAL SOURCE
739_russ_tedrake|UT THIS IS A CASE WHERE
739_sara_seager|NIT ISING AIR AND DESPAIR AND
740_matt_botvinick|SMALL GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE THE
740_richard_karp|WHAT EXTIP EGOSANPE WHAT IMPACT
741_dileep_george|I GROUND IT IN THE RIGHT WAY AND RUNTHE RIGHT SIMULITION
741_françois_chollet|UNLIKE ANYTHING THEY'VE SEEN THE TREE PROBS A THEY UNDERSTANDING
741_grant_sanderson|IS SEEN
741_manolis_kellis|AND THEN YOU KNOW A LOT OF THAT WILL GO UNDIGESTED
741_matt_botvinick|SKILL SET TO BUILD THESE KINDS OF SYSTEMS
741_russ_tedrake|AND EVEN THEN I THINK JUST HITTING
741_sara_seager|WHY DOES IT FEEL
741_sheldon_solomon|AS IT WILL WE
742_françois_chollet|O HOW DO WE DESIGN
742_jitendra_malik|DETA WHICH WAS DETA COLLECTED OF
742_sara_seager|MAYBE I'S JUST ME WHY AS  FEEL SO PROFOUNDLY LONELY
742_sheldon_solomon|IIF IT SAW
743_ben_goertzel|BUT WHAT THEY ULTIMATELY DID IS THE
743_grant_sanderson|AT THE MOMENT I THINK STUDENTS ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY INTERESTED IN THE THINGS THAT ARE WELL REPRESENTED ON YOU TO
743_ian_hutchinson|I MEAN I THINK IT WOULD BE A NIGHTMARE NOT A DREAM A NIGHTMARE
743_sheldon_solomon|INEXTRIPBLIQUE INEXTRICABLY CONNECTED A
744_ben_goertzel|TAKIN NAOTE DEEP NARRL NUT OR SOMETHING FOR PERCEPTION AND YOU  AS ONE OF THE
744_françois_chollet|A SOGONLY WE SHOULD
744_jitendra_malik|MAYBE TIS ELEVENT IT ALL
744_matt_botvinick|IS SOMETHING  THAT WE ALL HAVE TO BE TALKING ABOUT
745_dileep_george|TALK ABOUT CIPITI THREE A LITTLE BIT I THINK
745_grant_sanderson|OF EXPLAINING JUST SOMETHING BEAUTIFUL EXPLAINING IT CLEANLY TECHNICALLY NOT DOING
745_jitendra_malik|SO THAT PREDICTION SHOULD REALLY BE TAKEN WITH A HUGE GRAIN OF SALT
745_manolis_kellis|THE PLATEBO EFFECT OF WUAHM DOING SOMETHING TO INTERVENE ON MY DIET FROM THE
745_richard_karp|ON THE WORLD ANY IN EITHER WAY CASE IF P IS UNEQUAL TO ENPE WHICH IS WHAT WE EXPECT
746_dileep_george|SO I HAVE I HAVE IN
746_françois_chollet|FALSE KEE ACQUISITION ABIDITY
746_ian_hutchinson|HUMAN LEVEL OR SUPERHUMAN LEVEL INTELLIGENCE A THE A ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS
746_manolis_kellis|TALK ABOUT THE IMPLICATIONS OF THAT IF I GIVE YOU A SUGAR PEEL AND I TELLYOU TO SUGAR PEEL
746_richard_karp|AND WE KNOW THAT WEE IN THAT FOR
746_russ_tedrake|AND THE OTHER FOOT CAME OFF THE GROUND JUST A LITTLE BIT
746_sheldon_solomon|ALL RELIGIONS
747_ben_goertzel|WHICH IS LIKE A AMEMORY MATRIX  STORES SEY THE MAP OF THE LONDON SUBWAY OR SOMETHING SO
747_jitendra_malik|I SHOULD BE
747_richard_karp|HOWEVER
748_françois_chollet|TASKS THAT CANNOT BE ANTICIPATED NOT JUST BY THE SYSTEM ITSELF BUT BY THE CRETOS OF THE SYSTEM
748_ian_hutchinson|ALMOST A RELIGIOUS OR A PERSPECTIVE THAT WAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT OF THE SPECIAL ASPECT OF HUMAN NATURE
748_russ_tedrake|AND THEN HAHAHTHE THING IS ONCE YOU GET OFF THE SCRIPT
748_sara_seager|LIKE I SOMETIMES TREAT MYSELF TO IMAGINE THINGS LIKE THIS
749_grant_sanderson|THAT WENT INTO
749_ian_hutchinson|OF US CREATING
749_matt_botvinick|PHILOSOPHY PAPERS WRIT WE'VE IN TRYING NOT TO WRITE HIS PHYSICIAN PAPERS WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT
749_sheldon_solomon|AT THEIR BUS
750_ben_goertzel|PEOPLE FROM THOSE TWO DIRECTIONS
750_dileep_george|AM BUT IT WILL STILL HAVE THE FUNDAMENTAL LIMITATIONS THAT
750_ian_hutchinson|INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS THAT EXHIBIT SOME ELEMENTS
750_manolis_kellis|BETWEEN OURECOGNITION AND OUR BIOLOGY
750_richard_karp|ALL WE KNOW IS THAT IF A PROBLEM IS NOT IN PEDE IT THEN IT CAN'T BE SOLVED EFFICIENTLY ON ALL INSTANCES
750_russ_tedrake|IT DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT THIS SITUATION SO IT WAS PREDICTING THINGS THAT WERE JUST WRONG
750_sara_seager|BUT WHEN HE IMAGINED THAT THIS PLAN IS NOT
751_grant_sanderson|PROPOSING THAT TILIKE A NETWORK T V STATION
751_jitendra_malik|THERE CAN BE SYSTEMS WHICH CAN BE HIGHLY PERFORMAD BUT WHICH ARE INTERNALLY
751_matt_botvinick|HINKING ABOUT WHAT IT REALLY MEANS FOR
751_russ_tedrake|AND THEN WE
751_sheldon_solomon|FOSTER PROSOCIAL BEHAVIOR
752_dileep_george|AH AND IT CANT RUND SIMILATIONS IN ITS HEAD TO FIND WHETHER SOMETHING IS
752_manolis_kellis|THE POWER OF A BRAIN TO TROV
752_russ_tedrake|ID A VIOLENT SHAKE AND FELL OFF IN OUR A FACE FIRST ON OUT OF THE RUBBA BUT
752_sheldon_solomon|TOWARDS THE INGROUP
753_dileep_george|TRUE IN THE WORLD OR NOT
753_françois_chollet|OF LAKE WHAT ARE
753_ian_hutchinson|THERE IS SOME SUCCESS TO A I I ALSO THINK THAT AN
753_jitendra_malik|DO YOU THINK WE WILL EVER
753_matt_botvinick|PET IN O PARADOX IM YOU KNOW TO BE BOUGHT TO BE BROUGHT INTO CONTACT WITH THESE EH E SYSTEMS IN A WAY THAT
754_ben_goertzel|AY AY A LONG TIME AND HAVE MADE THEIR CAREER AT DEVELOPING
754_françois_chollet|IT'S A
754_ian_hutchinson|WHICH ARE ENORMOUSLY INFLUENTIAL AND OBVIOUSLY DO THINGS MORE POWERFULLY THAN ANY INDIVIDUAL HUMAN OR EVEN ANY
754_matt_botvinick|CONCRETE TAYOU CAN GET HOLD OF YAN IT ALLOWS YOU TO  DEFINED THE PROBLEM IN SOME WAY THAT
754_richard_karp|IN YOUR OWN LIFE OR JUST IN GENERAL IN THE FIELD THAT YOU HAVE EVER COME ACROSS OR HAVE DEVELOPED YOURSELF OH
754_sara_seager|IT'S JUST ALL ALONE OUT THERE
754_sheldon_solomon|THAT'S THE GOOD NOUS
755_ben_goertzel|ONE ASPECT LIKE A COGNUF ARCHITECTURE OR OR
755_dileep_george|AND FORMING A COMPRESSED REPRESENTATION
755_grant_sanderson|SO EVEN IF ITS TINGS THA
755_ian_hutchinson|COMBINATION OF HUMANS COULD DO MUCH FASTER AND
755_russ_tedrake|AM INO BOSTENDAAMEX AND AND
755_sara_seager|TO ME IT WAS HIS LITTLE DISCOVERY
756_ben_goertzel|DEEP LEARNING APPROACH
756_dileep_george|YOU THINK IN THAT CULD EMERGE
756_grant_sanderson|YOU MIGHT THINK YOUR NICHE
756_ian_hutchinson|AND AND A ACCESSING
756_manolis_kellis|SO THERE'S SOMETHING TO BE SAID ABOUT SOT OF POSITIVE THINKING ABOUT OPTIMISM ABOUT ROUV YOU KNOW JUST
756_matt_botvinick|UM OF COURSE THE SAFETY ISSUES
756_richard_karp|VERY MUCH WHAT WAS THE STABLE MATCHING PROBLEM
756_russ_tedrake|ANNI MALL AND HR INCREDIBLE WORK ON ON LEGGED ROBATT'S HAPPENING AROUND THE WORLD
756_sara_seager|THAT I ACTUALLY FEEL PRETTY GOOD BEING PART OF THIS SOLAR SYSTEM
757_matt_botvinick|AN YOU KNOW IN IN IF ININ WITH ALL THE SUBTLETIES OF THAT RIGHT YOU KNOW HUMANS
757_richard_karp|IMAGINE THAT YOUWANT TO MARRY OFF
758_ben_goertzel|IT CAN BE HARD TO MENTALLY
758_grant_sanderson|ACRELLY ENGAGED WITH IT REALY DEEPLY ALTHOUGH I'VE JUST PSYCHOLOGICALLY WATCHING HIM I CAN'T SPEAK FOR LOD PEOPLE I SPEAK FOR MY DEAD I THINK THERE'S A
758_richard_karp|AND EACH BOY HAS AN ORDERED LIST OF HIS PREFERENCES AMONG THE GIRLS HIS FIRST CHOICE IS SECOND CHOICE
758_russ_tedrake|AND THEY HAVE TYPICALLY POINT FEET RELATIVELY THEIR BALLS ON THEIR FEET FOR INSTANCE IF THAT IF THOSE ROBOTS GET IN A SITUATION WHERE
758_sara_seager|AND IT FELT LIKE IT SUCKED FOR THE ROGUE PLANET
759_dileep_george|A MARCOTANE ORF FOLTEST FOSTODER IN AN IFEU IF VEU A GO DO
759_jitendra_malik|NON ANKNONS AND UNKNOWN AKNONS
759_manolis_kellis|THAT THE BRANK THAT THE BRANK AN RDUCE AH THE BRANK CAN HELP CURE CANCER IS A
759_richard_karp|TO HER AND CHOICE
759_sheldon_solomon|YOU KNOW THERE THE ONES IN SOL POSSESSION
760_ben_goertzel|THO THA WORLD OR YO'LL BRAGT O WORLD THAT WOLL
760_jitendra_malik|IN THE BUSINESS WE ARE IN
760_manolis_kellis|I EVEN KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH THAT I MEAN THE WAITED TO THINK ABOUT THAT IS THE FALLING
760_matt_botvinick|PURE AI RESEARCH
760_russ_tedrake|LAYERS OF MECHANISMS THAT WILL MAKE I THINK THE THE MORE MATURE SOLUTIONS HAVE HAVE
760_sheldon_solomon|OF THE LITURGICAL PRACTICES OR WHATEVER THEY CALL THEM
761_manolis_kellis|THE CONVERSE OF THE EQUATION
761_matt_botvinick|AM A NUMBER OF PEOPLE AT DEEP MINED AH
761_richard_karp|EACH CURL ALSO HAS A UNORDERING OF THE BOYIS THE FIRST CHOICE SECOND CHOICE AND SO ON
761_russ_tedrake|WAYS IN WHICH
761_sara_seager|IN YOURSELF YOU DON'T KNOW TOTALLY I MEAN THERERE SOME RODE PLANETS
762_dileep_george|HIGH ORDER MORALS OR MORE A SOPHISTICATE DESTRUCTION IN THE MODEL LEG THAT RANSOM ON ETOSCAU
762_grant_sanderson|AH FEAR OF LIKE EMBARRASSMENT LIKE THEY THEYT DEFINITELY
762_ian_hutchinson|AN DAY TURND SO FULL SO IS THAT SOMETHING IS THAT IS THAT ENTER THE REALM OR SOMETHING WORTH SHOULD BE CONCERNED ABOUT
762_manolis_kellis|SOMETHINGTHAT WE ARE MUCH MORE COMFORTABLE WITH
762_sara_seager|THAT ARE JUST BORN ON THEIR OWN I KNOW THAT SOUNDS REALLY WEIRD TO BE HOW CAN YOU BE BORN AN ORPHAN
762_sheldon_solomon|YU KNOW RELIGION AT ITS BEST
763_richard_karp|WE WILL SAY THAT A MATCHING A ONTO ONE MATCHING OF THE BOYS WITH THE GIRLS
763_sara_seager|BUT THEY JUST ARE THEAS MOST PLANETS ARE BORN
763_sheldon_solomon|INTO YEUR CRUSADES AND HOLICOSTS
764_ben_goertzel|WHEN I STARTED MY TRAYER
764_dileep_george|THE WOOL IT'S IT'S A MODEL OF THE TEXT WORLD AND IT WILL HAVE IN INTERESTING
764_grant_sanderson|PUT OUT A VIDIO
764_ian_hutchinson|ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
764_matt_botvinick|TAKING SOMETHING IN TRADITIONAL REINFORCEMENT LEARNING AND JUST TWEEKING IT SO THE THING THAT THEY TOOK FROM TRADITIONAL REINFORCEMENT LEARNING WAS W
764_richard_karp|IF THERE ARE
764_sheldon_solomon|MY VIEW
765_ben_goertzel|I REALLY THOUGHT QUALM COMPUNING WOULD BE NECESSARY FOR ER A G A
765_jitendra_malik|I FEEL WITH RESPECT TO NATURAL LANGUAGE
766_ben_goertzel|I DOUBT IT'S NECESSARY NOW ALTHOUGH I THINK IT WILL BE AN AN
766_dileep_george|JUST SKALING IT A IS NOT GOING TO
766_françois_chollet|THAT
766_grant_sanderson|I DON'T KNOW IT'S THIS IMPOSTOR SYNDRUM LIKE WHO AM I TO TALK ABOUT THIS AND THAT
766_jitendra_malik|UNDERSTANDING AND HIGHLIVL COGNITION
766_manolis_kellis|IS YOU KNOW PERHAPS THE SAME BATHWAYS PERHAPS DIFFERENT PATHWAYS BUT AGAIN SOMETHING THAT
766_matt_botvinick|HOW WELL THINGS ARE GOING YOU'RE EXPECTED AM CUMULATIVE FUTURE REWARD AND A THAT'S USUALLY REPRESENTED AS A SINGLE NUMBER A
766_richard_karp|SUCH THAT THE BOY IN THE FIRST
767_ben_goertzel|INHANCEMENT BUT I MA I'M ALSO
767_dileep_george|GIVETH A DIA OR
767_françois_chollet|THATS SUCH A FASCINATING PRIOR UM THAT LIKE
767_grant_sanderson|THAT'S TROUE FOR LIKE EVEN THINGS THAT YOU'VE STUDIED FOR LIKE YOUR WHOLE LIFE I DON'T KNOW IT'S SCARY TO POST I FIN YOU TOO
767_matt_botvinick|SO IF YOU IMAGINE A GAMBLER IN A CASINO
767_russ_tedrake|WE MOSTLY IN ROBADICS ARE AFRAID OF CONTACT ON THE REST OF OUR BODY
767_sheldon_solomon|BECAUSE I'M LIKE
768_françois_chollet|IS SO FUNDAMENTAL IT IS FANONOS WIL TEM AND CONITION
768_grant_sanderson|IT IS GARRY AH
768_jitendra_malik|I'M FRAMED TO THAT
768_sara_seager|BY OTHER PLANETS LIKE A GAME OF BILLIARD BALS SOMEHI JUST GETS KICKED OUT WE ACTUALLY THINK THERE'S PROBABLY AS MANY ROD PLANETS AS STARS
769_ben_goertzel|THEIR PROTOAGIO SYSTEMS AND AND DESAUNT DESIGN THE BEST FRAME WORK FOR THE FOR THE NEXT STAGE AND I DO THINK
769_françois_chollet|THERE AND A A DE SEGON PRIOR THAT SORTS O FANAMANTOLIS
769_grant_sanderson|I HONESTLY WISHED THAT ORE  THE PEOPLE O HAD THT
769_matt_botvinick|RUPT THAT KIND OF DISTRIBUTIONAL REPRESENTATION REALLY
769_sara_seager|ALL FLYING OUT THERE HOW FUNDAMENTALLY ALONE SO THE BOOK
770_grant_sanderson|LIKE WE'RE JUST STARTING TO RESEARCH AT TWO WEEKS AGO AND AR ON A CERTAIN SCHEDULE
770_jitendra_malik|MIGHT BE POSITIVE IN THAT THEY'LL SURPRISED US AND MAKE THE JOB MUCH EASIER
770_matt_botvinick|ACCELERATED REINFORCEMENT LEARNING AND LED TO BETTER
770_richard_karp|WHO WANT TO RUN AWAY WITH EACH OTHER LEAVING THEIR PARTNERS BEHIND
771_ben_goertzel|SUCCESSES WITH
771_dileep_george|VERY MUCH LIKE
771_grant_sanderson|AND WHO MAY BE SHOULD
771_ian_hutchinson|SUBJECTIVE EXPERIENCE THAT WE SEEM TO BE HAVING THEZ
771_jitendra_malik|SO FUNDAMENTAL BREAK THROUGHE I THINK THAT IS POSSIBLE BECAUSE CERTAINLY IAVE BEEN VERY POSITIVELY SURPRISED BY
771_manolis_kellis|IN THE GENUM IN FRONT OF THE GENES THAT NEED TO BE TURNED ON
771_sara_seager|AS ABOUT YOUR LIFE AND IT A
772_grant_sanderson|THINK LIKE WHOM I TO EXPLAIN
772_manolis_kellis|I DON'TNOW WHEN YOU DRINK COFFEE
772_sheldon_solomon|UT DON'T COME HOME IF YOU DONT
773_ben_goertzel|SYSTEMS A MEAN PEOPLE MADE THESE
773_dileep_george|ATIEU YE A SO IN ORDER TO FORM THAT KIND OF COMPRESSION
773_françois_chollet|AND AND ONE OF THE DUT IS AN AGENT AND ITS GOOL IS TO AVOID THE OTHER DAT AND ONE OF THE DATS THE OTHER DAT IS
773_grant_sanderson|TRUES YOUR FAVORITE TOPIC QUANA MECHANICS OR SOMETHING AM AND TAT THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE THE SELF AWARENESS
773_ian_hutchinson|I THINK THAT THERE IT'S AN INSTINCT QUESTION I THINK IT'S ACTUALLY A
773_jitendra_malik|SYSTEMS HAVE BEEN BECAUSE I CERTAINLY WOULD NOT HAVE
773_sheldon_solomon|MARRY A JEWISH WOMAN THEY
774_grant_sanderson|YOU'RE GOING TO BE MAKING ON LINE CONTENT ANYWAY IT'S HAPPENING RAY
774_jitendra_malik|BELIEVED THAT IN TWO THOUS AND TEN
775_ben_goertzel|THAT KNOWLEDGE APPROPRIATELY IN OUR OUR OPENCOG TUPONO SYSTEM
775_dileep_george|THAT POSSIBLE
775_jitendra_malik|THAT I THINK AH
775_russ_tedrake|IKE WET HOUT
775_sara_seager|PATH OF YOUR LIFE AND YOU LOST YOUR HUSBAND JUS
776_dileep_george|NO I DON'T THIK IT IS POSSIBLE BECAUSE THE INFORMATION IS NOT BARE THER THE INFORMATION IS SIR
776_jitendra_malik|AF WHAT WE KNEW FROM THE MATHEMATICAL THEORY
776_manolis_kellis|SO THERE'S BASCULLY THESE SMALL
776_matt_botvinick|ASO IF YOU IMAGINE
777_françois_chollet|ITS SOMETHING THAT'S E AR
777_ian_hutchinson|WE ARE NOT COMPUTERS
777_manolis_kellis|THESE MOTIFS WORK IN COMBINATIONS AND EVERY ONE OF THEM HAS SOME
777_sara_seager|THE NAME OF THE BOOK IS THE SMALLEST LIGHTS IN THE UNIVERSE
778_jitendra_malik|AS GREAT INDICENTICHNICS WOULD WORK NOW THESE ARE
778_manolis_kellis|RECRUITMENT AFFINITY
778_richard_karp|IN WHICH AM
779_dileep_george|SO THAT'S AN ARGUMENT THAT LIKE TEXT IS A LOT LOWER FIDELITY THAN THE
779_françois_chollet|A WAS DAT
779_ian_hutchinson|WHAT MIND IS IS
779_manolis_kellis|FOR A DIFFERENT PROTAIN
779_matt_botvinick|STANDARD DEEP REENFORCEMENT LEARNING AGRETHMS ARE GOING TO TAKE THOSE TWO SITUATIONS AND KIND OF
779_richard_karp|EACH BOY STARTS MAKING PROPOSALS TO GIRLS
779_russ_tedrake|THE ART OF CONTACT IT'S LIKE IT'S BECAUSE YOU'RE YER YOUR YOUR PICKING CONTACT POINTS
780_ben_goertzel|BECAUSE FOOLISH JOURNALISTS OVERBLOW THEM AS AS AS BEING THE PATH TO
780_ian_hutchinson|IS GENERALLY SPEAKING BY ANALOGY THAT WE ARE BASICALLY WET
780_richard_karp|AND IF THE GIRL RECEIVES THE PROPOSAL SHE ACCEPTS ITTENTATIVELY
780_sheldon_solomon|UNLESS WE CAN OVERCOME THIS TRIBLE
781_ben_goertzel|A G I AND AND A FEW RESEARCHES OVEROVERBLOW THEM AS A AS WELL THERE
781_dileep_george|IT'S ALMOST LIKE IF YOU COULD
781_ian_hutchinson|WET WER K AM THAT WI THAT WE'RE SOME COMPUTER LIKE
781_matt_botvinick|THE THE THING THA YOU 'RE TRYING TOBE
781_sara_seager|SEARCHING FOR THE EARTHS
781_sheldon_solomon|MENTALITY
782_jitendra_malik|LE CERTIN NEED NOT AND I THINK EVERYWHERE
782_richard_karp|AND THE BOYS START GOING DOWN THEIR LISTS PROPOSING TO THEIR FIRST SECOND THIRD CHOICES
782_russ_tedrake|GAME THEORETIC SITUATION WITH THE HUMAN THAT STILL HARD AH
783_dileep_george|WE HAVE A TAXCORPUS THAT INCLUDES
783_richard_karp|AND YET STOPPING
783_sara_seager|SMALLEST LIGHTS IN THE UNIVERSE
783_sheldon_solomon|UT BUT YOU SAID EARLIER SOMETHING LEC THAT I THINK IS PROFOUND AND PROFOUNDLY IMPORT MAR
784_ben_goertzel|OPENCOG TUPOINA IS A TERM WE'RTH THROWING AROUND
784_dileep_george|BASICLY
784_françois_chollet|IS IS THAT SHAP EVER DHE DEVISION OF FIRLSHIP OR NOT A WHAT YOU SEE IS THAT
784_grant_sanderson|HERE IT IT WASN'T BECAUSE OF MONEY IT'S BECAUSE
784_matt_botvinick|BUT WHAT IF INCE WHAT IF WHAT IF THOSE TWO SITUATIONS ACTUALLY HAVE DIFFERENT
784_richard_karp|A  PROPOSAL IS ACCEPTED
784_russ_tedrake|HEART OF IT FOR INSTANCE YET MAY BE EVEN THROWING THE GAME THEORY OUT OF IT ALMOST LIKE A
784_sheldon_solomon|AND NAT IS YOU DID NOT RECOIL IN HORROR
785_ben_goertzel|SORT OF TONGUE AND CHEEK BECAUSE THEE
785_dileep_george|TROLIENS OR
785_jitendra_malik|FOR THE RUT WIDE RANGE OF PROBLEMS FROM A WIDE RANGE OF INITIALIZATIONS AND SON
785_manolis_kellis|THOSE EARS AND ONES AND AFLITHEM
785_matt_botvinick|VALUE DISTRIBUTIONS
785_richard_karp|TOP PREFERENCES
785_sara_seager|I REALLY HOPE THAT YOU OR THE OTHER PEOPLE LISTENING NEVER GET
786_françois_chollet|IS LINIALLY PROBOTIONAL
786_ian_hutchinson|AND IF THAT'S THE CASE THEN REALLY MY MIND IS NOT REPRODUCE
786_richard_karp|AND AM
786_sara_seager|TO THE PLACE
786_sheldon_solomon|ON THE BIG FAN OF FACH
787_ben_goertzel|IS NOT REMOTELY CLOSE TO WHAT WE'D CONSIDER WE'D CONSIDER ANT A ONE POINT O RIGHT AMIN EMINENTS IT IT'S AN EARLY
787_dileep_george|STORE
787_grant_sanderson|THAT'S NOT A GOOD FEELING LIKE AND JOE DIN DOESN'T FEEL LIKE HE CHO WAS ON HIS SIDE
787_ian_hutchinson|REDUCIBLE TO SOME KIND OF SOFT WARE WHICH CAN BE CONSIDERED TO BE PORTABLE IT IS SO
787_jitendra_malik|MOE RAPID PROGRESS THAN
787_manolis_kellis|YOU PROBABLY WAN'T EVEN NOTICE
787_richard_karp|ONE CAN PROVE THAT AH
788_dileep_george|THE INFORMATION
788_ian_hutchinson|ARE CONNECTED TO THE HARDWARE OF MY BODY THAT THE TWO ARE INSEPARABLE
788_manolis_kellis|THEIR FIRST RESILIENT
788_matt_botvinick|IN THE INTERNAL REPRESENTATION THAT MIGHT OTHERWISE BE CONFLATED OR SQUISHED TOGETHER AND MAINTAINING IS DISTINCTIONS CAN BE USEFUL IN
788_russ_tedrake|INCREASINGLY FOCUSED ON MANIPULATION
789_dileep_george|METED THAT'S ARCHITECTURALLY YOU HAVE LIKE YOU HAVE THOUGHTS ABOUT THE LIMITATION ON THAT SIDE OF
789_grant_sanderson|THAT LIKE OUR OBVIOUSLY SHOULD BE INTRENDING BECAUSE THEY'RE NERVOUS ABOUT LIKE
789_jitendra_malik|BUT THEN THE'RE CERTAINLY LOTS OF TIMES IN FACT
789_manolis_kellis|AND THEN ANYTHING ELSE AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT THES IINCREDIBLE BEAUTY OF LIFE
789_russ_tedrake|PARTLY WHERE THAT'S A CASE WHERE THE CONTACT HAS TO BE MUCH MORE RICH AN
789_sheldon_solomon|AND BY THE WAY THIS SUGGESTED THAT E
790_ben_goertzel|ACTUALLY WERE
790_dileep_george|THINGS  WUTNE ON MY WORKS ANSO TRAMSOMERIES IN STILL EFUDE FOR WARD NEWA NETWORK THAT THE A ITS ITASE
790_françois_chollet|ARM WITH A FIXED SPEED
790_grant_sanderson|NINO OF TIS CONCIDE IS A
790_ian_hutchinson|AM YOU KNOW ARE IN A SIRE ARE IN A SENSE OF
790_jitendra_malik|MOST OF THE HISTORY AN VIAES WHEN WE HAVE MADE LESS BROG PROGRESS AT US LOWER LATE THAN WE EXPECTED
790_manolis_kellis|IT'S A MESS IT'S IN OTHER THE WAY TO GET THERE
790_russ_tedrake|AND THERE ARE SOME REALLY IMPRESSIVE EXAMPLES OF OF DEEP LEARNING
791_ben_goertzel|GOING BACK TO
791_ian_hutchinson|INVOLVED WITH THE BRAIN AND WIIN THE MIND BTNOT IN A VERY SIMPLE WAY LIKE YOU KNOW LIKE THE LUTER ANALOGY
791_matt_botvinick|WHAT IS DOP MEAN
791_richard_karp|OTH I I WOULD SAY YOU AM AND YOU ALSO HAVE THE OBSERVATION THAT
791_sara_seager|WHILL MAYBE WE CAN TELL THE FULL STORY
792_ian_hutchinson|AH IN A MUCH MORE COMPLICATED WAY
792_richard_karp|YOUYOU HAVE TO
792_russ_tedrake|HAT CAN APPEAR TO DO GOOD THINGS THROUGH
792_sara_seager|BEFORE WE TALK ABOUT THE GLIMMER
793_ben_goertzel|THEORY AND IMPLEMENTATION CAUSE WE FEEL LIKE THAT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO BUT I'M SURE WHAT WE END UP WITH IS GOING TO HAVE
793_matt_botvinick|WELL THIS  THIS THIS IS ALSO A CASE WHERE THERE IS A HUGE AMOUNT OF DETAIL AND DEBATE BUT
794_françois_chollet|TEST OF MACHINE TASENTS AND HUMAN INTATIONS SHOULD FOLLOW AND THE OCCHANGE IS
794_jitendra_malik|UNWARRANTED ARTHESE
795_ben_goertzel|I LONKED TOGETHER WITH SEVERAL OTHERS IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT
795_dileep_george|N IT WILL BECOME BETTER AND BETTER WITH MORE DETTA OR BIGGER MORALS BUT
795_jitendra_malik|SO I AGREE WITH YOU BUT I'VE ALSO
795_russ_tedrake|UT I THINK
795_sheldon_solomon|I DON'T SEE
796_dileep_george|THAT IS ONLY GOING TO GET SO FAR IU NO FINAL LEVEN NEW IN SO I HAD THIS JOKE ON A
796_françois_chollet|SO AN YOU HAVE SET OF A TASKS THAT'S WHAT THEY AR CALL AND FOR EACH TASK YOU HAVE
796_jitendra_malik|GOT IN THE CHANCE TO INTERRACT
796_sheldon_solomon|HUMANTS
797_ben_goertzel|THAT WAS DEVELOPED
797_françois_chollet|A TRAINING DATA WHICH IS A SET OF INPUT AND ADPUT BAS
797_grant_sanderson|WO REALLY THATSN'T GOING TO HIS FULL LENGTH THE CLIPS A GON TO STAY BUT THE FULL LENGTH VIDIOS ARE ALL
797_ian_hutchinson|THAT WILL MEAT THAT THE MIND WILL
797_manolis_kellis|BECAUSE OF THE PRESSURE TO KEEP IT COMPACT SO MANY COMPACT GENUMS OUT THERE HAVE ANCESTORS THAT WERE MUCH LARGER
797_richard_karp|AM THE HOSPITALS HAVE THEIR PREFERENCES
797_russ_tedrake|MAKE A DECISION BASED ON THOSE MODELS QUICKLY
798_ben_goertzel|AH ITS A PROPRIETARY COBES WITHIN MY E  COMPANY NOVERMANTE LAL SI
798_dileep_george|CURIOUS ALMOST
798_françois_chollet|TU A ER AND ER AN INPUT ART PUTBER IS AGRIVED
798_ian_hutchinson|VANISH AS A CONCEPT
798_richard_karp|BUT IF
799_françois_chollet|OF CORAUS BASICALLY DEGREED THE SIZE OF THE GRET ISVABLES IS IN THE SIZE OF THE GREAT
799_grant_sanderson|AS PART OF THE DEAL AND LIKE THAT'S THE FIRST TIME WHAT IT WAS LIKE
799_manolis_kellis|YOU GO THROUGH A LOOP OF ADABUNCHOR STAFF INCREASE COMPLEXITY AND THEN YE KNOW SLIM IT DOWN
799_richard_karp|RESIDENT A
800_françois_chollet|AH IS VABON
800_grant_sanderson|OH YOU TOO VIDIAAS MIYGH NOT LIVE FOR EVER LIKE THINGS YOU FIND
800_matt_botvinick|VALUE REPRESENTATIONS HOW DO YOU LEARN THEM HOW DO YOU UPDATE THEM BASED ON EXPERIENCE WELL IF YOU
800_richard_karp|IS GOING TO PHILADELPHIA THEN
801_ben_goertzel|FROM THAT SOMETHING WE LOST TO TALK ABOUT IS SINGULARITY NAT SO YE YEIBORN AS A NON NETWORKED THING
801_dileep_george|YE SO LIKE AM
801_jitendra_malik|AG I I THINK THAT E I IS BEING USED IN MANY SYSTEMS TO DAY
801_russ_tedrake|THERE'S MUCH MORE SUBTLE TO YOU
801_sara_seager|BLOCKAGE IN HIS INTESTINE
802_dileep_george|IT'S KIND OF YEARN I COMPLETELY AGREE WITH YOUR INTUITION IS JUST THAT I DON'T WANT TO ADOGMATICALLY
802_françois_chollet|AND SE YEUCHON A FEW DEMONSTRATIONS
802_grant_sanderson|LET'S SAY ONE HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS LET'S SAY SOME CRAZY NUMBER AND THEN REMOVES IT FROM YOU TWO
802_ian_hutchinson|EVEN IF IT'S IMBEDDED IN
802_russ_tedrake|BUT HE MIGHT STILL BE HARD TO ACTUALLY YOU KNOW
802_sara_seager|LIKE NOTHING COULD GET OUT NOTHING COULD GET IN
803_ben_goertzel|THERE ARE MANY LEVELS OF NETWORKS IN OININVOLVED HERE RET CANNOT GIVE YOU TO THE INTERNETE
803_grant_sanderson|ITS MAY BE
803_ian_hutchinson|INO CONTINUOUSLY INTO PHYSICS AND TEMPSTRY AS I RATHER SUSPECT IT IS IAM SO I
803_jitendra_malik|BE HAMP FUL LUMMING A DECISIONS WHICH COULD BE UNFAIR TO SOME PEOPLE OR IT COULD BE A SELF DRIVING CARDS WHICH KILLS UP I DUSTRIO
803_manolis_kellis|I WOULD AHOLD YOU TEPEGATION EVENT HAPPEN
803_sara_seager|AND IT WAS PRETTY PRETTY SHOCKING TO EVEN HEAR THEN THAT IT COULD BE NOTHING
803_sheldon_solomon|HE JUST SEDBELIEFS OR THE BASIS OF ACTION IF YOU DON'T HAVE ANY BELIEFS YUREPARALYZED WITH INDECISION
804_ian_hutchinson|THAT THAT'S MY OWN VIEW I MEAN
804_manolis_kellis|IS COINCIDING WITH ABOUT A HUNDRED MILLION YEARS AGO AND
804_matt_botvinick|AT LEAST ROUGHLY ONE OF THE THINGS THAT IT'S DOING AM
804_richard_karp|DEEM I SHO THE FACT THAT YOU HELD THIS ADDITIONAL CONSTRAINT
804_russ_tedrake|NA MODEL OF YOUR HUMAN OID AND FIGURED OUT HOW TO
805_ben_goertzel|YA I AM IN SINGULARITY IN E
805_françois_chollet|AT ASSUMPTIONS
805_ian_hutchinson|ANOTHER WAY OF PUTTING IT IS THA
805_manolis_kellis|THE EMERGENCE OF FRUIT BEARING PLANTS
805_richard_karp|IT IS NOT JUST THE PREFERENCES OF INDIVIDUALS BUT THE FACT THAT THE
806_dileep_george|SOI GLACDLY IS NOT NAT A I THIN ASO I GUESS THE RECURSION THE THE FEE BAC MECHANISM
806_grant_sanderson|AAND THEN THEY LETE YOU KNOW
806_matt_botvinick|IT'S NOT ONLY THE VALUE THE VALUE FUNCTION THAT'S REPRESENTED AS A SINGLE NUMBER IT'S ALSO THE ROR PREDICTIONARY
807_ian_hutchinson|AS MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE VIEW POINT
807_jitendra_malik|LEAT OUR CONSEQUENCES
807_richard_karp|AVE TO GO HAVE TO BE ASSIGNED TO THE SAME PLACE
807_russ_tedrake|IT SO EFFORTLESS
807_sheldon_solomon|RIGHT OR WRONG
808_ben_goertzel|THAT THE THERE THERE ARE DIFFERENT LAYERS YET AT
808_dileep_george|THE IDEA OF CONCEPTS ALSO MEMORY
808_ian_hutchinson|HISTORICALLY I DO THINK THERE IS YOU KNOW THERE IS SOMETHING ADDED TO HUMANS BUT IT'S NOT
808_matt_botvinick|AND THAT'S WHERE THE PAPER CAME FROM WE W CAN HAVE ENUMERATED A SET OF PREDICTIONS ALL OF WHICH ENDED UP BEING FAIRLY CLEARLY CONFIRMED
808_russ_tedrake|LIKE I CANJUST AM VERY COGNIZANT OF THE ENTIRETY OF THE LEARNING PROCESS BEING ESSENTIALLY LIKE
809_dileep_george|COTIC WE HAVE A CALONUMENT A PISOTIC MEMORY NOW Y
809_françois_chollet|CORNALESH PRIORS SHOULD NOT REQUIRE ANY
809_grant_sanderson|IT WOULD BE SHOCKING IF YOU TWO REMAIND AS POPULAR AS IT IS NOW
809_manolis_kellis|ALONG WITH THE SEED
809_matt_botvinick|REPRESENTING SURPRISED SIGNALS IN A WAY THAT
809_sara_seager|OR IF THE DOCTOR'S PURPOSELY
810_ben_goertzel|D BE USED  IMPLAMEN
810_françois_chollet|OUTSIDE KNOWLEDGE SOR FOR INSTANCE
810_ian_hutchinson|DOWN THE ROAD OF UNDERSTAND WE WILL GET MUCH FURTHER
810_jitendra_malik|IT IS WE
810_manolis_kellis|OR THE PLANS TO SPREAD
811_françois_chollet|AH NO LANGUAGE
811_ian_hutchinson|THE THEN WE HAVE
811_sheldon_solomon|BUT ALSO
812_dileep_george|OW DO YOU FORM
812_françois_chollet|AH NO ENGLISH NOTHING LIKE THIS A NEW CONCEPTS AE TAKEN FROM A A
812_ian_hutchinson|AND WIC
812_richard_karp|YOU HAVE HUMAN SMATCHING WITH INSTITUTIONALISTSION
812_sara_seager|WHAT WE WERE
812_sheldon_solomon|ALSO FAITH SHOULDN'T BE A DOGMATIC THING THAT DO
813_jitendra_malik|I AM SAYING THAT THESE PROBLEMS EXIST TO DAY NER AND WE NEED TO BE CONTINUOUSLY ON THE LOOK OUT FOR
813_russ_tedrake|UH SI YOU'RE LEARNING IT INTELLECTUALLY A LITTLE BIT
813_sara_seager|OWARD THE THINKS YOU ARE SUFFERING FOR
814_ben_goertzel|THERE'S BEEN A GROUP OF DEVELOPERS WHICH I'VE BEEN LEADING TOGETHER WITH LENUS VEPSTUS NIL GEISWALLER AND A FEW OTHERS
814_grant_sanderson|PUT THAT KNOWLEDGE OUT THERE IN THE WORLD
814_ian_hutchinson|EXTREMELLY PRIMITIV
814_jitendra_malik|WEDRING ABOUT SAFETY BY SAYS
814_manolis_kellis|AHODIUUMDUPLICATION WHICH HE NITUALEES AN VERY MESSY EVENT
815_grant_sanderson|EMITEEAN BEYOND
815_matt_botvinick|ARY IS THAT YOU CAN SEE BRAKE THROS IN THE NEXT
815_richard_karp|
816_ben_goertzel|TO IMPLEMENT CERTAIN IDEAS ABOUT HOW TO MAKE IN AN A GEAA SO THAR THERE'S BEEN A LITTLE BIT OF AMBIGUITY ABOUT OPEN COG THE SOFTHWORE PLATFORM
816_matt_botvinick|LET'S GET CRAZY NOW JUST THREE OR FIVE YEARS BUT NEXT TEN TWENTY THIRTY YEARS
816_richard_karp|BY THOUGH THE OGWEM YOU MENTIONED WASN'T WASN'T T ONE OF YOURS AND NO NO THAT WAS DUE TO NGALE AN CHAPLY AND
816_russ_tedrake|I'M NOT EVEN SURE IF THAT'S SOB
817_dileep_george|BE CAREFUL OFOUT SIMILAR SITUATION
817_grant_sanderson|NEVA A SET OF BEAUTIFUL DETAIS ON YOUR OW LAT WORKS
817_ian_hutchinson|AND SOME PEOPLE SPEAK AS IF IS A GOOD THING THAT SOMEHOW
817_manolis_kellis|SAL BUT WITH THE DUPLICATION
817_matt_botvinick|THAT WOULD MAKE YOU
818_françois_chollet|RIGHT AND SOME OF THE TASKS I SHOULD DESIGN TO TO PROB A BITS OF THAT THEORY AND THEYE ARE THINGS THAT ARE
818_jitendra_malik|THIS IS NOT ABOUT AGIA
818_manolis_kellis|AT FIRST WHEN YOU HAVE SIX WHEN YOU GO TO SIXTEEN YOU ARE NOT USING THAT O YAR YOUR
818_matt_botvinick|AND PERHAPS HE'LL BE PART OF
818_richard_karp|OR IDEAS STEMMING FROM THE STABLE MATCHING IDEA
818_sara_seager|THE PINKER IS  YOU CAN'T FEEL ANYTHING SO BY THE TIME YOU FEEL PAIN IT'S TOO LATE IT'S SPREAD ALREADY SO I WAS JUST LIKE BESIDE MYSELF WEN LIKE MY
819_ben_goertzel|ARE INDEED WE'VE BEEN BUILDING BUILDING ON TOP OF IT
819_dileep_george|USING YOUR OTHER GIANTS TATIS IN INOTHE THE MORTAL OF THE WORLD THAT YOUHAVE LEARNED ALTHOUGH THE SITUATION CAME FROM THE EPISODE
819_françois_chollet|A TURN OUT TO BE VERY EASY FOR HUMANS STO PERFORM INCLUDING YOUNG KIDS RIGHT THE TURN OUT TO BE
819_grant_sanderson|WHAT IS THEM
819_jitendra_malik|IN FACT IT'S ABOUT ALREADY DUMB INTELLIGENCE WITH ALL KILLING PEOPLE THE WORRY PEOPLE HAVE WITH AGAI IS THE SCALE
819_manolis_kellis|YE SOBISKY FROM ONEDAY TO THE NEXT
819_russ_tedrake|IT FEELS LIKE THERE'S A LOT OF DISTRIBUTED LEARNING COHANCON
820_ben_goertzel|SO THE COR COMPONENT OF OPEN COG IS A SOFTFIRE PLATFORM
820_dileep_george|YOU NEED BE ABLE TO INDEXT THE OTHER ONE SO OH
820_françois_chollet|NO IMPOSSIBLE FORMISSIONS
820_jitendra_malik|BUT I THINK YOULL HAUNT A PER SEND RIGHT
820_manolis_kellis|YOU WENT FROM HAVING EIGHT CROMISMS HAVING SIXTEEN PROMISM
820_matt_botvinick|THERE'S A GREAT DEAL OF INTEREST NOW IN WHAT'S GOING ON IN AYI
820_russ_tedrake|YE I THINK THERE'S
820_sara_seager|HOW DID YOU DEAL WITH IT
821_ian_hutchinson|AND US
821_jitendra_malik|LIKE THE THING THAT WEARS ME ABOUT A I TO DAY
821_matt_botvinick|AND AM
821_richard_karp|WHETHER ITS BEAUTY ELEGANCE OR
821_russ_tedrake|HIERARCHY IN COMPOSITION HEHE UM
821_sara_seager|EMOTIONALLY PSYCHOLOGICALLY
822_françois_chollet|WHAT CAN YOU CLARIFY BLE OU MEAN ONE OF THE THINGS YOU WANTED TO TRY TO UNDERSTAND WAS
822_grant_sanderson|MATHEMATICALLY
822_ian_hutchinson|IE DID SO TO UNDERSTAND
822_jitendra_malik|AND IS HAPPING IN A HUGE SCALES RECOMMRECOMMENDER SYSTEM O RECOMMENDATION SYSTEMS SO IF YOU LOOK AT A TOITER A FACEBOOK AT YOU TOO
822_richard_karp|BEING THE RIGHT DISCOVERY
822_russ_tedrake|NEN A SYSTEM THAT'S CAPABLE OF ME PLANNING A VACATION TO
823_dileep_george|OTHER A MORTAL TAGGER BILLING
823_ian_hutchinson|I MEAN THAT THERE'S A THIS IM
823_richard_karp|DEVELOPMENT IN YOUR LIFE THAT YOU ARE ESPECIALLY PROUD OF
823_russ_tedrake|SOME DISTANT COUNTRY WHICH IS PROBABLY
823_sheldon_solomon|YOU HAVE ALREADY SUCCUMBED ANDTO EITHER LAZINESS OR DOGMATISM OR BOTH THAT'S REALLY WELL PU
824_grant_sanderson|YOUWELL THINK WHAT I WOULD GO TO THE LAYERED STRUCTURE AND HOW  YOU CAN HAVE
825_jitendra_malik|DAY I MEAN MY LIFE WOULD NOT BE THE SAME WITHOU
825_manolis_kellis|SO NINETY PER CENT OF THOSE GENIES WERE ACTUALLY LOST
825_richard_karp|SO AN
825_sheldon_solomon|SO WOULD HE MAKE OF CONSCIOUSNESS SO D'YE THINK DEATH
826_grant_sanderson|ESPECIALLY IF YOU LOOK AT LIKE SOME OF THE VISUALIZATIONS THAT LIKE CRYSOLA HAS DONE WITH RESPECT TO AM
826_russ_tedrake|MAKE A PRETTY COMPLEX
826_sara_seager|DOCTORS LIKE IT COULD BE NOTHING
827_ben_goertzel|THIS A GENERALIZED HYPROGRAPH
827_grant_sanderson|LIKE CONVOLUTIONAL NETS THAT HAVE BEEN TRAINED ON IMAGE NET TRYING TO SAY WHAT DOES THIS NURON DO OR TO THIS
827_ian_hutchinson|AND THAT IT WAS CREATED FOR THAT DELIGHT AS MUCH AS IT WAS
827_matt_botvinick|THE EXPERIMENTS THAT HAVE EXPLOITED THIS TECHNOLOGY
827_russ_tedrake|PICK THREE GAME OR SOMETHING
827_sheldon_solomon|A CONSCIOUSNESS IN TURN
828_ian_hutchinson|AM FOR ANY OTHER REASON AND THAT
828_manolis_kellis|RANDOM MUTATION
828_sheldon_solomon|MAGNIFIES
829_ben_goertzel|SO SIMILARLY
829_manolis_kellis|OF THE ROOSELESS ELECTION
830_ben_goertzel|YOU COULD HAVE A LINK
830_dileep_george|AH TO REINSTANTHE TO REPLAY THAT MEMORY
830_manolis_kellis|ASKY MEANS THAT AS SOON AS ONE OF THE RAND IMITATIONS HIT ON JEAN
830_russ_tedrake|AM AND APPARENTLY YOU PICK THREE ITEMS AND THEN YOU PICK HE SAYS WE CAN PICK THE FIRST ONE UP WITH YOUR RIGHT HAND THE SECOND ON UP WITH YOUR LEFT HAND WIT
831_dileep_george|SO HOW DO YOU FIND THAT MEMORY I WHICH DIRECTION IS THE IMPORTANT DIRECTION
831_jitendra_malik|ANA FIST OFF COLD
831_matt_botvinick|IT'V BEEN TRICKY TO COME UP WITH WAYS OF FELICITING INTERESTING BEHAVIOR FROM A MOUSE THAT'S
831_sara_seager|YOU HAVE WON YOUR LIVE OR TWO OR THREE
832_richard_karp|SO THE THE IDEA OF THE M
833_françois_chollet|A AND EUNIQUE
833_grant_sanderson|AM THOSE MANY DIFFERENT LAYERS OF AN UNDERSTANDING TO SOMETHING IF FORM ABSTRACTIONS IN A AUTOMATED WAY
833_ian_hutchinson|BETWEEN SAYING THAT AAN INTELLIGENT CREATOR
833_matt_botvinick|WELL LET'S TRY TO BRING BEHAVIOUR INTO THE PICTURE LET'S TRY TO LIKE REINTRODUCED BEHAVIOR WHICH WAS SUPPOSED TO BE WHAT THIS WHOLE THING WAS ABOUT I
833_sara_seager|OU'VE ON YEAR TO LIVE  WHAT WOULD YOU DO
834_françois_chollet|AND UNPREDICTABORL
834_ian_hutchinson|HAS SET UP THE UNIVERSE
834_matt_botvinick|I'M HOPING THAT
834_russ_tedrake|I THINK  THE AMAZING THING IS THIS ABILITY TO BE FLEXIBLE WITH OUR MODELS AND PLAN WHEN WE NEED TO USE AR
834_sara_seager|FOM ME
834_sheldon_solomon|SO A LOT OF PEOPLE
835_dileep_george|THEN AGAIN USED THE HIPPOCAMPAS TO BRIBE THE
835_manolis_kellis|OR THIS GENIS NNOW
835_matt_botvinick|THOSE TWO TRANS
835_richard_karp|SOME NUMBER
835_sara_seager|IZETAM
835_sheldon_solomon|I THINK DAN WAGNER AT HARVARD
836_ben_goertzel|ANYWAY WHAT WE HAVE AN OPEN COG
836_françois_chollet|YOU'RE YOUR ON LITTLE WORLD
836_grant_sanderson|AND THE IDEA THAT IT CAN BE SO SIMPLY MATHEMATICALLY REPRESENTED I MEAN A TON OF LIKE MODERN AND MAIL RESEARCH SEEMS A LITTLE BIT LIKE YOU DO A BUNCH OF ATHAWK THINGS
836_ian_hutchinson|AND SET IT IN MOTION
836_jitendra_malik|A LOT OF IT IS ABOUT BEING AT THE RIGHT PLACE AT THE RIGHT TIME
836_manolis_kellis|PRESSURED TO TO DO TWO DIFFERENT FUNCTIONS
836_richard_karp|OR SOME COMMENTORIAL OBJECT THAT
836_russ_tedrake|HAVING MODELS I THINK THE OTHER THING YOU JUST SAID WAS SOMETHING ABOUT
836_sara_seager|DOES I BRING YOU JOY DOES IT TO BRING YOU FULFILMENT AND BASICALLY
837_ben_goertzel|WE HAVE AN ATOSPACE WHICH IS THIS WEIGHTED LABEL GENERALIZED HYPROGRAPH KNOWLEDGE STORE
837_françois_chollet|A SIMPLE ENOUGH THAT IT WOULD BE POSSIBLE FOR HUMAN TO REVERSE INGENERATS
837_ian_hutchinson|AND IS
837_jitendra_malik|AND YOU CAN
837_richard_karp|DESCRIBES THAT WORD
838_ben_goertzel|SO THERE'S A PATTERN MATCHER
838_françois_chollet|AND WRITE DOWN A ANALGRISM THAT COULD
838_manolis_kellis|NEW FUNCTION
838_matt_botvinick|WE'LL COME TOGETHER OR
839_françois_chollet|YOU ARE NOT A VERY GOOD SOURCE AF FAR INFICABLE NOVELTY AND SO YOU HAVE TWO
839_ian_hutchinson|INTEGRATED WAY
839_jitendra_malik|MATIEUR AND YOU CAN ONLY
839_russ_tedrake|MUSCLES OR OR A BALANCE COMPONENTS THAT YOUST WAREN'T EVEN AWARE OF BEFORE
839_sara_seager|PHELAKE TO DAY
839_sheldon_solomon|WE ARE
840_dileep_george|WHAT ER GOING TO SEE NEXT
840_françois_chollet|ACE THE CREATION OF THESE TASKS IA QUITE A BIT THERARE ONLY SO MANY UNIQUE TASKS THAT YOU CAN DO IN A GIVEN DEAY
840_grant_sanderson|THE CRAZINESS OF
840_richard_karp|ASSOCIATE WITH EACH WORD A NUMBER
840_sara_seager|I YOU KNOW LIKE I KIND A WOKE UP LUCKY FALLS NERVEUS ABOUT TALKIN TO IM
840_sheldon_solomon|AWARE OF WHAT IT IS
841_ben_goertzel|AND THEN SEARCHED THROUGH A WHOLE ATOM SPACE WITH LEVELLED HYROGRAPH TO SEE WHAT
841_dileep_george|AON THE NUL NETWORKSIDE IT'S A IT'S INTERESTING TO THINK OF HOW WE ACT YOU DO THAT
841_manolis_kellis|ND WHAT I TELL THEM EAS WELL WE CAN STUDY THE AVELUTIONARY DYNAMICS OF THE CORRENGENO TO THEN UNDERSTAND
841_matt_botvinick|COMPUTATIONAL MECHANISMS THAT WERE COMING TO UNDERSTAND IN A AY I YOU KNOW IF WE CAN DO THAT THEN WE MIGHT BE TAKING A STEP CLOSER TO THIS CL
841_richard_karp|SO WE FIRST OF ALL WE THINK OF THE LETTERS THAT OCCA OCCUR IN A WORD AS THE DIGITS OF IT LET SAY
841_sheldon_solomon|IT ITS JUST BASICALLY AN INTEGRADED RENDERING OF SOMETHING THAT'S ALREADY
842_grant_sanderson|MINIMA LOCAL OPTIMA THERE IS IN THE SURFACES AND SOMEHOW
842_ian_hutchinson|HE SIMMULATION
842_manolis_kellis|WHICH MUTATIONS HAVE PREVIOUSLY HAPPENED OR NOT
842_matt_botvinick|UTOPIAN FUTURE THAT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT EARLY OR WEARE THERE IS REALLY NO DISTINCTION BETWEEN PSYCHOLOGY AND NERA SCIENCE
843_ben_goertzel|THEN THERE'S
843_françois_chollet|ARDEDISAT THAT WOULD ALSO BE FREE OF POTENTIARINO SOMEE FOR MY OWN PERSONAL BIASIS
843_manolis_kellis|AND WHICH MUTATIONS HAPPEN IN GENES THAT EVOLVE RAPIDLY OR NOT
843_richard_karp|EING BE DIGITS OF THAT NUMBER
843_sheldon_solomon|THDAWKINS IN THE SELFISH GENE
844_ben_goertzel|SOMETHING CALLED THE
844_dileep_george|PROPERTIES OF
844_françois_chollet|IS THERE ALWAYS NEED TO BE A PART OF ARC THAT'S A THE TEST LIKE IT'S HIDDEN
844_grant_sanderson|THAT'S REALLY SURPRISING WELL SO ON THE ONE HAND IT IS BUT ALSO IT'S LIKE NAT
845_françois_chollet|YES ABSURTLY IT IS IN PRESOF THAT A
845_grant_sanderson|DOESN'T FEEL AS
845_jitendra_malik|ABSOLUTELY
845_matt_botvinick|WHATEVER IT IS THE BRAIN IS FOR AND
845_richard_karp|THAT WORD VIEWED AS A NUMBER
846_dileep_george|CLIEN LOOKING AT BIOLOGY AND THE HISTORA HISTORY OF
846_françois_chollet|LOTS OF PEOPOR JUST IN COULDN'T CAGE E STALE KNOW ENJOIN IT AS A GAINSO I THINK THAT'S LETS AN CREGING
846_grant_sanderson|MESMERISING TO THINK ABOUT OWE THERE SOME SURFACE OF
846_jitendra_malik|USE LESS FEELIN
846_matt_botvinick|AND WHAT IS THE BRAIN FOREST FOR BEHAVIOR I FEEL LIKE WE COULD I FEEL LIKE WE COULD
846_richard_karp|AND TAKE THE REMAINDER ON
846_sara_seager|AN IF THAT'S WHAT YOU WOULD DO
847_dileep_george|OR EVOLUTIONARY HISTORY OF INTELLIGENCE IT IS PRETTY CLEAR THAT OUTCAVE WADDLESNID IS
847_grant_sanderson|HICH IS MAYBE WHAT YOUARE DESCRIBING THAT SOMETHING AS DUME IS RADIANT DESCENT DOES IT
847_ian_hutchinson|IS IS THE FOLLOWING IS OER OF THE ANALOGY
847_manolis_kellis|TATVISL MEANS THAT IT'S A COMPLETELY NEW ADAPTATION TO HUMAN
847_richard_karp|DIVIDING THE DIVIDING THAT NUMBER BY
847_russ_tedrake|ARAROBA
847_sheldon_solomon|CONSCIOUSNESS
848_dileep_george|MORE STUCTURE IN THE MODELSTS AND THE MORDELLING OF THE WORLD AND SUPPORTING DYNAMIC
848_françois_chollet|I THINK
848_manolis_kellis|AND THAT METATION HAS NOW GONE FROM
848_russ_tedrake|I MEAN IT'S VERY HARD TO
849_matt_botvinick|YOU ILL SO AS MEDDY I
849_russ_tedrake|TO SAY ONE THING IS HARDER ON SOME PROBEMS HARDER THAN THE OTHER WUT PROBABLY MATTERS IS
850_françois_chollet|TAKIN THE QUESTIONS LIKE
850_grant_sanderson|THAT'S THAT'S WHAT'S INTERESTING IT'S SIMILAR TO A
850_matt_botvinick|I THINK I THINK THE ONE OF THE KEY
850_russ_tedrake|WHO WHO WHO STARTED THE ORGANIZATION THAT THAT I MEAN I THINK ROEBECUP HAS A PRETTY SERIOUS FOLLOWING IN THEIR IS A HISTORY NOW OF PEOPLE
850_sheldon_solomon|DOKIN SAYS IS HE THOUGHT ABOUT IT IN TERMS OF JUST THAT WE CAN DO MENTAL SIMULATIONS
851_ian_hutchinson|CHRISTIAN VIEW OF CREATION AK
851_jitendra_malik|I I GOT IN AT A TIME WHEN THE FIELD WAS
851_manolis_kellis|MOVING FROM HUMAN TO HUMAN
851_sheldon_solomon|THAT O ONE
852_ian_hutchinson|I DON'T THINK IT'S AKING PLACE IN SOME OTHER
852_jitendra_malik|VERY YOUNG AND AT A TIME WHEN IT IS
852_richard_karp|O WHICH USUALLY ARE COMMENTORIAL AND DON'T INVOLVE A THE IDEA OF TAKING A RANDOM FINGERPRINT YES
853_dileep_george|INNO THRE IS THE SCIEN FICTIONSIN AR YOUR PHINO
853_françois_chollet|THE WIFFETS
853_ian_hutchinson|UNIVERSE THAT GOD HAS MADE AUGAIE I THINK MAY BE ITS TAKING PLACE IN THE MIND OF GOD
853_matt_botvinick|FLEXIBILITY AND A THE FLECT THE KIND OF FLEXIBILITY THAT HUMANS HAVE IN TWO SENSES ONE IS THAT
853_russ_tedrake|I THINK ALMOST INDEPENDENT OF WHICH PROBLEM IS TECHNICALLY HARDER IS THERE BOTH HARD AN THEY'RE BOTH DIFFERENT
853_sheldon_solomon|PRODUCT OF CONSCIOUSNESS IS TO RATHER THAN A FIND OUT
854_ian_hutchinson|ONE OF THE ENTITIES IN THE UNIVERSE AND AND PRESUMABLY THEREFORE IS VERY DIFFERENT FROM A SIMULATION THAT WE MIGHT RUN ON A COMPUTER
854_jitendra_malik|MATURE BUT NOT FULLY MATURE IT MITS MATURE BUT NOT DONE I MEAN A GRELIIN SELINA IN A PRODUCTIVE FAIRS YETINGLUSA
854_sara_seager|WO WERE THE BUCKETLESS THINGS FOR YOU THAT YOU REALIZED LIKE WHAT AM MI DOING WITH MY LIFE
854_sheldon_solomon|BY ADVERSE CONSEQUENCES THROUGH TRYING SOMETHING WOULD BE TO RUN MENTAL SIMULATIONS AND SO ONE POSSIBILITY
855_ben_goertzel|IT SUD DESIGN
855_jitendra_malik|OU HAVE ALSO MENTERED SOME OF THE BIGGEST
855_matt_botvinick|EXPERT AT ONE THING
855_richard_karp|DIDGET BY DIDGRT WE CAN
855_russ_tedrake|GO ON A TABLE AND BASICALLY FIGHT SO MAYBE I'M WRONG MAYBE FIRST OF ALL DE OF A YEAR IN MINE FOR A ROBLE CUP
855_sara_seager|THAT WAS THE MAJOR KONSE OF HIM AFTER HE DIED I DIDN'T KNOW LIKE I
856_grant_sanderson|THAT' SURPRISE WE TEND TO THINK LAKE
856_jitendra_malik|NAMES OF COMPUTER VISION AT BETTER SCIENCE THAN AI TO DAY A
857_ben_goertzel|AND SO THAT THAT'S A VERY DIFFERENT PROCESSING MODEL
857_dileep_george|HELPING PEOPLE OVERCOME OR SOME LIMAGICIONS NOW AT SOME POINT OF COURSE IT WILL ADVANCE THE LEVEL OF
857_matt_botvinick|THEY CAN SWITCH BUT BETWEEN THINGS
857_sara_seager|WAS O TOUGH TO
857_sheldon_solomon|INTELLIGENCE
858_ben_goertzel|THEN SAY TE
858_jitendra_malik|WHAT I'VE ALWAYS TRIED TO TEACH THEM IS A SENSE OF PICKING THE RIGHT PROBLEMS
858_manolis_kellis|BUT WHAT DO YE DO WITH THAT
858_matt_botvinick|AND THEY CAN PICK UP NEW THINGS VERY QUICKLY BECAUSE THEY THEY VERY
858_sara_seager|TO FIND AN ANSWER FOR THAT AND THAT'S WHEN I SETTLED ON I'M GOING DEVOTE THE REST OF MY LIFE TO TRYIN TO FIND ANOTHER EARTH
858_sheldon_solomon|SO MUCH AS SOCIAL INTELLIGENCE
859_ben_goertzel|MATRIX MULTIPLICATION BASED MODEL AS UNDERLIES MOST DEEP MOST DEEP LEARNING SYSTEM TO WRITE SO SO YOU COULD
859_grant_sanderson|IT SEEMS WEIRIDLY EASY TO FIND
859_jitendra_malik|SO A I
859_manolis_kellis|NEDATION IS THE PATH TWO NEW THINGS BUT ALSO THE PATH TO BREAK OLD THINGS
859_sara_seager|AND TO FIND OUT
860_dileep_george|OF DOING ALL OF THE SAFELY
860_jitendra_malik|I THINK THAT IN SCIENCE IN THE SHORT RAN
860_manolis_kellis|IS THAT THIS POSITION WAS EXTREMELY PRESERVED
860_russ_tedrake|MACHINES HAVE BEAT HUMANS AT A GAME IN H PHYSICAL SPACE YET BUT THAT WILL BE JEST
861_dileep_george|YE SO  SO HICH BEING ABLE TO WELL CONNECT ELECTRODES AND NOT JUST THOUSANDS BUT LIKE MILLIONS TO THE ABRAT
861_ian_hutchinson|AND A RESTORE
861_richard_karp|SIMPLE
861_sara_seager|WHAT IS THAT LONGING FOR CONNECTION WITH OTHERS IH
861_sheldon_solomon|THERE SEEMS TO BE SOMETHING OM
862_ben_goertzel|IS BECAUSE YOU WANT TO MAKE AGENTS THAT ARE
862_françois_chollet|WHAT DO YOU THINK YE THINK THIS SOMETHING THAT CONTINUES FOR HER
862_jitendra_malik|TECHNICAL COMPETENCE YEUR
862_matt_botvinick|BELIEF BUT
863_dileep_george|QUITE A INTERS IN YOUR PLASTISIT IS PRETTY MALLUABLE GOT IT SO'S GOIN I JUST GOT IT
863_grant_sanderson|AH LIKE ONE FUN EXAMPLE OF THIS YOU KNOW I'M CHANNON'S NOISY COATING IN THEOREM A NOISY COATING THEOREM IN A INFORMATION THEORY
863_ian_hutchinson|AH
863_matt_botvinick|A FOCUS ON ABSTRACTION
863_richard_karp|IT'S UNLIKELY IF THE PRIME IS CHOSEN RANDOMLY FROM A CERTAIN RANGE THAT YOU WILL GET
864_françois_chollet|S WANTING I THINK WE DID WELL A WITH ARC
864_grant_sanderson|THE BASICALLY SAYS IF IN I WANT A SENSE SOME BITS TO YOU A MAYBE
864_richard_karp|TWO OF THE SEGMENTS IN QUESTION HAVING THE SAME FINGE PRINT
864_russ_tedrake|OUD PLAY ITS YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GET
864_sara_seager|NEVER HEARD SOME ONE SAY THIS BEFORE BUT HE'S LIKE SARAH YOU KNOW
864_sheldon_solomon|NATURE'S VIEW WOULD BE THAT YOUR THOUGHTS OF YOURSELF WOULD NEVER COME TO MIND
865_ben_goertzel|BOTH COGNIVH ARCHITECTURE IMPORTANCE BECAUSE THEN THIS HYPOGRAPHIS BEING USED AS A SORT OF
865_dileep_george|IT'S INTERESTING WHETHER WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO FIGURE OUT
865_françois_chollet|ITS PROVING TO BE A VERY AN
865_grant_sanderson|A SOME OF THE MERGINE ET FLIPPED
865_matt_botvinick|EXECUTED BEFORE BUT YOU KNO MAKE SENSE FOR A PARTICULAR SET OF DEMANDS
865_richard_karp|AND SO THEREIS A SMALL PROBABILITY OF ERROR WHICH CAN BE CHECKED AFTER THE FACT
865_sara_seager|WHY ARE WE EVOLVE TO
865_sheldon_solomon|I DON'T KNOW HOW I FEEL ABOUT THAT THOUGH
866_grant_sanderson|THERE SOME NOISE ALONG THE CHANNEL
866_ian_hutchinson|IT SEEMS LIKE A VERY IMPORTANT MOMENT
866_richard_karp|AND ALSO THE EASE OF DOING THE COMPUTATION BECAUSE YOU'RE WORKING WITH THESE FINGER PRINTS
866_sara_seager|TAKE DEATH SO HARSHLY
866_sheldon_solomon|THE SOUNDS WEAR BUT A IN A CENCE
867_ben_goertzel|THE SOPHORN HOGWAR IMPLEMENTATION IMPLICATIONS AS CURRENT GEEP EW ARCHITECTURES ARE NOT SO USEFUL FOR OPEN CUG
867_dileep_george|SMISCICALLY SAYING
867_manolis_kellis|E BASICLLY TELLS US HERE IS THE REGIONS THAT ARE
867_matt_botvinick|A AN INTERESTING NEW CHAPTER A
867_richard_karp|WHICH OU REMAINDERS MODULO SOME BIG
867_sheldon_solomon|I FEEL LIKE
868_françois_chollet|AT THE SAME TIME
868_grant_sanderson|THIT'S VERY GOOD UM AND THEN HE QUANTITATIVELY DESCRIBES HAT VERY GOOD IS
868_manolis_kellis|HERE IS THE REGIONS THAT ARE MOST LIKELY TO MUTATE GOING FORWARD
868_russ_tedrake|A BETTER'S WAYS THERE'S ABETTERS LOOPOLES
869_françois_chollet|I WE'LL STEAL VERY FAR FROM AING SORT OF ITS AND THAT'S SACTIONY A
869_jitendra_malik|ENDEARSHIN THAT THIS PROBLEM IS RIPE
869_sara_seager|SO I THINK THAT IS TIED HAND IN HAND WITH WHY DER WE WHY DO WE SEEK CONNECTION
870_grant_sanderson|IS RATHER THAN SAYING LIKE HEARS HOW TO CONSTRUCT IT OR EVEN LIKE A SENSIBLE NON CONSTRUCTIVE PROOF THE NATURE OF IS NOT CONSTRUCTIVE PROOF IS TO SAY
870_matt_botvinick|I IN PARTICULAR BY AM SUSAN FISK  AT AT PRINCETON IN THE DEPARTMENT I USED TO AM WRASE TO WORK AM
870_richard_karp|ELL IT'S SEM JUST THE ABILITY TO DRAW A RANDOM NUMBER FROM
870_sara_seager|IT'S JUST THAT WE WEU'RE TALKING ABOUT BEFORE THAT SUBCONSCIOUSNESS THAT WE DON'T UNDERSTAND
871_ian_hutchinson|ONE AY OSSE TOUCH IN YOUR BOOK BUT
871_jitendra_malik|SO I THINK THAT IS THAT IS IMPORTANT A
871_richard_karp|SUCH AM
871_sheldon_solomon|AN A LIVING THING
872_ben_goertzel|NO MORPHIT COMPUTING
872_dileep_george|BUT AGAIN IF WE TAKE A STEP BACK I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOUR INTUITION IS I FEEL LIKE THAT T
872_ian_hutchinson|ONE THAT I ASK EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE IS WHAT IS THE MEANING OF LIFE
872_manolis_kellis|OVERCOME THIS LOCAL MAXIMUM THAT IT HAD REACHED IN THE
872_russ_tedrake|FUNNY I I I NEVER WATCHED THE EPISODE
872_sara_seager|IS THAT THE THING ENDS
873_ben_goertzel|HOULD BE AMAZING
873_dileep_george|IS NOT AS HEART OF A PROBLEM AS
873_grant_sanderson|WHICH IS WEIRD BECAUSE THEN IT TOOK DECADES FOR PEOPLE TO ACTUALLY FIND ANY THAT WERE ANYWHERE CLOSE TO THE LIMIT
873_richard_karp|VERY SIMPLE IF WE'RE CONDUCTING A PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION
874_ian_hutchinson|UTIT BUT THEY ARE ALL KIND OF CENTRE AROUND
874_russ_tedrake|BECAUSE I GAVE A TARK
875_jitendra_malik|THAT'S OF SOME VALUE
875_matt_botvinick|AND BUT THE OTHER DIMENSION IS WARMTH
875_richard_karp|ICK THE WINNER
875_russ_tedrake|TO SOME ALMIGHTY FACULTY
875_sara_seager|YOU WOULDN'T WANT A LIMIT LIKE ITS
875_sheldon_solomon|IS BECAUSE THERE'S SOMEBODY ELSE THA TELLS ME
877_dileep_george|SO THAT THE SOGERYPART OF IT WILL DEPARTED WITH THE THE LONG TOM
877_françois_chollet|IN THE CONTECTS OF MICHIONANING YOU SAY A A SYSTEM JORLIZES IF IT CAN
877_grant_sanderson|SOMETIMES WHEN YOU CHOOSE A RANDOM ELEMENT FROM THIS UNGODLY HUGE SET
877_manolis_kellis|HAD BASICALLY DESIGNED EVOLUTION
878_dileep_george|PECUSSION POT OF IT
878_françois_chollet|A MEXINS
878_jitendra_malik|FOR THAT AND FOR MANY OTHER REASONS I REALLY ENJOYED THIS CONVERSATION THANK YOU SO MUCH AS A HUGE HONOR THANKS FOR TALKING TO EIT'S BEIN MY PLEASURE
878_manolis_kellis|WE WOULD STILL BE
878_russ_tedrake|SPOT AT THE TIME I WAS THE EARLY VERSION OF SPOT
878_sheldon_solomon|HE AW WET YE I DON'T KNOW HOW I FEEL ABOUT
879_dileep_george|GAIN I DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE WILL
879_françois_chollet|ARFENIN PUTIT AS IT HAS NOT YET SEEN AH AND THAT'S WHAT I WOULD CALL
879_grant_sanderson|AUSE IN THAT CASE THE RANDOM ELEMENT TO ACTUALLY IMPLEMENT IT AS A BIT OF CODEYOU OULD JUST HAVE THIS HUGE TABLE OF LIKE
879_ian_hutchinson|GRANDCHILDREN IN MY CASE AM AND SO FORTTHOSA
879_richard_karp|THAN THE MOST POPULAR CANDIDATES
879_sara_seager|THE FEAR OF DEATH IS AT THE CORPS OF EVERYTHING
880_ben_goertzel|THAT WOULD SEEM THAT IT WOULD MAKE MORE FEASIBLE
880_grant_sanderson|TELLING YOU HOW TO INCODE ONE THING INTO ANOTHER THAT'S TOTALLY COMPUTATIONALLY IN FEASIBLE SO ON THE SIDE OF LIKE HOW MANY
880_ian_hutchinson|CRUICIALLY IMPORTANT
880_jitendra_malik|AND EXPRESS THE P N
880_richard_karp|IN THAT GROUP  WOULD BE VERY LIKELY TO BE THE CORRECT
881_ben_goertzel|TO MAKE A LARGE SCALE TRULY
881_ian_hutchinson|AH THESE ARE ALL THE PLACES WHERE PEOPLE WHETHER THEY 'RE RELIGIOUS OR NOT FIND
881_richard_karp|CHOICE THAT WOULD COME OUT OF COUNTING ALL THE MILLIONS OF VOTES
881_russ_tedrake|THIS VIDIO HAD GOT UP THIS BLACK MIRROR EPISODE HAD CHANGED THE WAY PEOPLE WATCHED
881_sara_seager|THAT YOU THINK YOU DON'T THINK ABOUT THE MORTALITY OF YOUR DOG
881_sheldon_solomon|THAT SAPIANS
882_ben_goertzel|BILOGICALLY REALISTIC
882_françois_chollet|ITH RESPECT TOO
882_ian_hutchinson|BUT ULTIMATELY A I THINK A PERSON WHO HAS FAITH IN A CREATOR
882_jitendra_malik|SENDING UP AN EXPRESSIVE PIANTAT CALM SLASH LEG SPOD
882_matt_botvinick|N AN IN A I RESEARCH WE REALLY FOCUS ON THIS
882_russ_tedrake|LIKE ENJOY BEING AFRAID
883_françois_chollet|NOVELTY
883_grant_sanderson|YES THERE IS ANOTHER GOOD INSTANCE THERE WORTS LIK
883_ian_hutchinson|I AM WHO
883_matt_botvinick|CAPABILITY THING YO WE WANT OUR AGENTS TO BE ABLE TO DO STUFF YOU KNOW THIS THING CAN PLAY GO AT A SUPERHUMAN LEVEL THAT'S AWESOME AND BUT THAT'S ONLY ONE TO MENTION
883_richard_karp|SECONDLY WE CAN'T REALLY DO A PURELY RANDOM SAMPLE FROM THAT POPULATION
884_françois_chollet|AFOR THE SPECIFIC SYSTEM YOU ARE CONSIDERING SO I THINK A GOOD TIST OF INTAGENCE TRADECTORY A A
884_jitendra_malik|IF YOU ENJOY THIS THING SUBSCRIBED Y NEW TUBE REVIEW IT WITH FIRE STARS AND APPOPAD GAS
884_richard_karp|AND I GUESSED THIRDLY THERE COULD BE A TIE IN WHICH CASE EM
884_russ_tedrake|HOW FAR WE AWAY FROM US
885_dileep_george|SO IN IN MANY WARS
885_françois_chollet|A DUBIDITY TO GENERALISE TO NOVELTY O UN CERTAINTY THAT
885_grant_sanderson|LIKE ARBITRARILY HARD TO DESCRIBE WELL LET ME ASK YOU A IMENSION DI PITI THREE IT'S INTERESTING TO ASK
885_manolis_kellis|AND WHEN YOU'RE SENDING A SADELLIDE TO MARS
885_matt_botvinick|TO BE WARM
885_sara_seager|SORRY TO USE ROMANTIC TERMS LIKE LOVE BUT
886_manolis_kellis|WHEN SOMETHING GOES WRONG IT'LL BREAK DOWN
886_sara_seager|WHAT HE MAKE
886_sheldon_solomon|AR BOOK YOU DON'T LOOK LIKE ALL BOOKS PEOPLE
887_ben_goertzel|WHERE I DID SOME WORK WITH
887_jitendra_malik|AND NOW LET ME LEAVE YOU SOME WORDS FROM PRINCE MISCHKIN IN THE IDIOT BY DUSTAYAVHSKI D
887_manolis_kellis|AS OPPOSED TO BUILDING SYSTEMS THAT TOLERATE FAILURE
887_sara_seager|WHAT DID YOU LEARN ABOUT LOVE FROM
888_ben_goertzel|IARPA IN N IN DE CI INTELLIGENCE ADVENTERESEACH PROJECT AGENCY WE WERE LOOKING AT L
888_jitendra_malik|BEAUTY WILL SAVE THE WORLD
888_manolis_kellis|A REZILIENS TO THAT AND IFACT GET BETTER THROUGH THAT
888_matt_botvinick|SOME DESCENDANT OF IT I FEEL LIKE
888_sara_seager|FROM LOSING IT
888_sheldon_solomon|BUT WE THOUGHT IT WOULD BE
889_ben_goertzel|HOW DO YOU HOW DO YOU MAKE A BALOSKY REALISTIC SIMULATION OF SEVEN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE BRAIN
889_dileep_george|O ATINDE WOOD THICKEN RUN
889_ian_hutchinson|MIGHT HAVE SOME
889_matt_botvinick|STHE ULTIMATE TURNING TEST
889_richard_karp|ONE OF SEVENTEEN
889_russ_tedrake|I MEAN I I'M NOT A PSYCHOLOGIST E I THINK I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHY
889_sheldon_solomon|A BIGGER HEAD THAT WULD BE MORE WIDELY ALRED ON TA IT'S FUNNY BECAUSE I I'V FUN
890_dileep_george|A THINKS VICADEOUSLY JUST IN YOUR INYOUR INNER BRAIN AND SIMILARLY YOU CAN EXPERIENCE ANOTHER PERSON'S THORTS
890_françois_chollet|A ANY NEW SITUATION IS GOING TO BE SEMPORD
890_manolis_kellis|COMPUTING SYSTEMS
890_sara_seager|I LEARN TO LOVE THE PEOPLE THAT I HAVE MORE
890_sheldon_solomon|I DON'T KNOW IF I HAVE GOOD EXAMPLE VE FORGOT ALREADY BUT
891_dileep_george|BY IN O HAVING A MORTAL OF HOW THAT PERSON WORKS
891_françois_chollet|FROM AESTATIC DISTRIBUTION OF GOSSIPOR SITUATIONS AND THAT YOU ALREADY HAVE
891_grant_sanderson|SO IF IT CAN BE USED AND LIKE A MAN MACHINESAN BIOSIS WHERE IT'S JUST GIVING YOU A SPEW OF POTENTIAL IDEAS THAT THEN YOU CAN REFINE DOWN
891_manolis_kellis|A TO OUR COMPUTERS HE WOULD BASICALLY BE STARTING FROM SCRATCH IN MANY WAYS
891_matt_botvinick|THAT CANNOT ONLY CONVINCE US THAT IT KNOWS HOW TO REASON AND IT KNOWS HOW TO INTERPRET LANGUAGE BUT
891_richard_karp|AT'S AFAMOUS SIR
891_sara_seager|THE LITTLE THINGS
891_sheldon_solomon|I'M OFTEN SADDENED BY LIKE FRANSKOVKA I THINK HE WASN'T KNOWN IN HIS LIFE HEU BUT I ALWAYS WONDER LIKE
892_ben_goertzel|ULD BE IT WOULD BE AMAZING BUT THAT'S THAT SORT OF WITH MY COMPUTATIONAL NARROSCIENCE HAD AL RIGHT WITH AN AGE I HAD ON
892_grant_sanderson|A LIE IT SERVING AS THE GENERATOR
892_manolis_kellis|IT WOULD BASICALLY BE BUILDING NEW PARADIMES
893_ben_goertzel|JUST MORE INTERESTED IN THESE
893_grant_sanderson|AND THEN THE HUMAN SERFICE AS THE REFINER THAT SEEMS LIKE A PRETTY POWERFUL DYNAMIC
893_manolis_kellis|THAT DON'T TRY TO GET THE RIGHT ANSWER ALL THE TIME
893_richard_karp|ANY NUMBER A IN THE RAINS
893_russ_tedrake|I THINK THE FEAR IS CL A BIT CULTURAL THOUGH CSAND I MEAN YOU NOTICE
893_sara_seager|THE DISCOVERY
893_sheldon_solomon|HAVE SOLD MORE THAN ANY OTHER BOOKS
894_françois_chollet|FOR AN SPYSIC DUSK
894_ian_hutchinson|AS THE PART OF THAT MEANING IS THE PART OF YOUR FAITH A
894_manolis_kellis|THE RIGHT DANCEER MOST OF THE TIME
894_matt_botvinick|WE WE WE INWE IN INSTILL IN THEM SOMETHING THAT
894_richard_karp|ZERO THROUGH AND MINUS ONE
894_russ_tedrake|METAL MARVELS OR IF IT'S AM
895_dileep_george|TURN IT TO YOURSELF YOU CAN OPP IN IT IF THAT SAME MODLING THING IS
895_françois_chollet|DATS A WET YOU ID CALL ROTHERSNESS YOU ARE ROBBERS TO THINGS HTAKE NO MORL VALIATIONS AND SO ON AN
895_ian_hutchinson|LOVE AND LOYALTY ARE KEEPARTS SO
895_richard_karp|ND RAISE IT TO THE
895_sara_seager|BAH THE DOG PARTS YOUR JOURNEY A
896_ben_goertzel|BUT YOU ARE STILL PUTTING A SCARE PAGIN NTO A ROUND HOLE IN A CERTAIN WEND THE SAME IS TRUE
896_dileep_george|APPLY IT TO YOUR OWN MORDLING APADITUS
896_françois_chollet|HIGHER DEGREE WOULD BE
897_dileep_george|THAT IS WHAT GIVES LICE TO CONSCIOUSNESS I THINK WELL THAT'S MORE LIKE SELF AWARENESS THERE'S THE HARD PROBLEM OF CONSCIOUSNESS WHICH IS
897_grant_sanderson|I THE TWENTY TWENTY
897_manolis_kellis|OF THE SBARAMETER
897_matt_botvinick|GRATIFYING TOO HUMANS
897_sheldon_solomon|GET THE ATTENTIN
898_grant_sanderson|HAS BEEN FULL SURPRISED IF W YEA WHO KNOW LIKE WE MIGHT
898_matt_botvinick|I MEAN HONESTLY
898_russ_tedrake|VERY SOON NET WLL HURT US AH LAHOWDIYOU APPROACH
899_ben_goertzel|PARTICULAR AUGURATHEMS TO PUT THERE GOT IT GIVING BACK TRACK ON THE KIND OF
899_dileep_george|IT ACT IT SIKE
899_françois_chollet|THE CUFFEE CEPTESTE WHICH IS THE DENOTIONETE
899_manolis_kellis|THE COMPLEXITY OF THE ENTIRE HUMAN BRAIN
899_richard_karp|SO IF YOU DON'T GET BACK THE NUMBER EIGHT THAT IT'S A PROOF THAT A NUMBER IS NOT PRIME
899_sara_seager|GRIEF IS AN OCEAN
900_grant_sanderson|PATTERNS YOU KNOW LHANK YOU GIVE IT TA
900_manolis_kellis|WITH TRILLIONS OF CONNECTIONS
900_richard_karp|
900_russ_tedrake|HA I
900_sara_seager|OU WITH TINY ISLANDS
901_ben_goertzel|GENERAL
901_ian_hutchinson|I THINK IT'S SOMETHING LIKE
901_manolis_kellis|WITINAR INONURANS WITH MILLIONS OF CELLS TALKING TO EACH OTHER
901_richard_karp|END YOU CAN SHOW THAT EM
901_russ_tedrake|WHY SHOULDN'T PEOPLE BE AFRAID THERE'S A I THINK THERE'S THE VIDIO THAT WANT VIRAL
902_dileep_george|THAT SOMEHOW SEEMS TO BE AT LEAST FIRST HUMANS A DEEP MOTIVATOR
902_françois_chollet|UNKNOWN AND NONCE SO THINGS THAT COULD NOT
902_sheldon_solomon|ALL OF THE CLAIMS IF YOU KNOW WHEN OF
903_ben_goertzel|OPEN COG YOU CAN UPDATE THE WEIGHTS AND THAT CERTAINLY HAPPENS A LOT
903_russ_tedrake|SANG LIKE THIS AS IKE
904_ben_goertzel|BUT ADDING NEW NODES
904_françois_chollet|A SPECIFIC DOMAIN LIKE DRIVING OUT THE MESTICROBATICS YOU ARE CONSIDERING AN OPEN ENDED RENCH AND
904_matt_botvinick|AND ALSO GOIN TO MAGIC SPOON DACON SLASH LEXS AND USING CODE
904_richard_karp|AH OF VALUE
904_sara_seager|AND WOULD TAKE ME AWAY FROM MY DARKNESS TO WORK ON A PROJECT
905_françois_chollet|AR OF POSSIBLE DOMAINS
905_ian_hutchinson|YOU REACH A POINT WHERE YOU ARE YOU FEEL COMPELLED
905_richard_karp|ANUNEQUALLED YOU BUILK OUT A VIOLATION OF FAMAS
905_russ_tedrake|FOR SOME REASON LIKE YOU COULD JUST HAVE A CAMERA LIKE WITH SOMETHING ABOUT SPOT
905_sara_seager|LATER ON IT TURNED OUT TO BE A GROUP OF WOMEN MY AGE ALL WIDOWS ALL WITH CHILDREN IN MY TOWN
906_dileep_george|AN THEY JUST KIND OF CREATE GOALS A DIFFERENT LEVELS THEY LIKE MAKE UP GOALS
906_ian_hutchinson|PEOPLE SOUNDS VERY SCARY
906_matt_botvinick|BY ALL THE STUFF
906_sara_seager|AND IT WOULD BE EVEN THOUGH IT WAS A BIT MOROSE GETTING TOGETHER UM STILL VERY JOYFUL AT THE SAME TIME
906_sheldon_solomon|A ROBATS AND A ARTIFICIAL TELLSJAU SYSTEMS THAT A HUMAN CAN LOVE AND I THINK
907_françois_chollet|A IF IT'S A BOL
907_manolis_kellis|MODULER AUTOMATON
907_matt_botvinick|IT'S THE BEST WAY TO SUPPORT THIS POT GUEST AND THE JOURNEY I'M ON IN MY RESEARCH AND THE START A
907_russ_tedrake|TERRIFIED PEOPLES THEY LEY WHAT
907_sara_seager|WHAT WAS THE JOURNEY OF REDISCOVERING LOVE
907_sheldon_solomon|THERE'S SOMETHING
908_ben_goertzel|THEN ITS CHOOSING WHAT COLLECTION
908_ian_hutchinson|AM AND
908_manolis_kellis|WORK WITH OTHER COPIES OF ITSELF
908_matt_botvinick|ENJOY THIS THING SUBSCRIBE ON YOU TO REVIEW IT WITH THE FIVE STARS AN A POPOTCAS THE PORTD ON PATRION
909_matt_botvinick|FALLOWIN OTEFY
909_richard_karp|VALUES OF IN WEARE SOMETHING A LITTLE MORE ELABORATE HAS TO BE DONE BUT THAT'S A BASIC IDEA
909_russ_tedrake|ECAUSE SO MUCH OF OUR FUTURE IS UNCERTAIN
910_françois_chollet|CREATING A SYSTEM THAT IS
910_ian_hutchinson|TOWARDS ANOTHER
910_russ_tedrake|BT AT THE SAME TIME TECHNICALLY SPEAKING IT SEEMS LIKE WERE NOT THERE YET
910_sheldon_solomon|FOR A MOVE
911_ben_goertzel|CLOSELY CONNECTED TO EACH OTHER SO IN TERMS OF THE
911_dileep_george|A THAT MORTALITY TO COME TO THE QUESTION FOR A
911_françois_chollet|SO GENERAL THAT IT COULD
911_grant_sanderson|A WEIRD COMBINATION OF INTUITIVE AND AH
911_ian_hutchinson|JESUS WHOSE SERVICE IS PERFECT FREEDOM IN OTHER WORDS FOR US
911_russ_tedrake|I MEAN I THINK TECHNALOGY IS EM COMPLICATED IT CAN BE USED IN MANY WAYS I THINK THERE ARE
912_ben_goertzel|TYPE SYSTEM THERE 'S SOME LENGTHS THAT ARE MORE NURL NUT LIKE THAN JUST LIKE
912_françois_chollet|ECENTUI ACHIV
912_matt_botvinick|AND NOW LET ME LEAVE YOU WITH SOME WORDS FROM NEURALOGIST V S EMACHANDRAN
913_françois_chollet|A HUMAN SCILPARITY OVER
913_grant_sanderson|TESTED A M
913_manolis_kellis|CREATE A BRAIN

913_sara_seager|DO YOU STILL THINK DO YOU STAK TO THINK ABOUT YOUR IMMORTALITY
913_sheldon_solomon|IT'S BASED ON BECKER AND YOUR WORK
914_manolis_kellis|THAT IS INERVATED
914_matt_botvinick|IMAGINE ANGELS
914_richard_karp|OPPORTUNITIES
914_russ_tedrake|WHEELED ROBUTS IT COULD BE USED IN BAD WAYS TO
914_sheldon_solomon|AN HEIDEGER
915_françois_chollet|II DON'T ACTUALLY THINK HUMAN SAS AL ANYWHERE NEA A DE
915_grant_sanderson|LIKE THAT SORT OF PATTERNMATCHIN RECOGNITION THA
915_ian_hutchinson|CAPTIVITY BUT IN
915_matt_botvinick|CONTEMPLATE THE MEANING OF N INFINITY
915_russ_tedrake|OUNS TRONES RIT A
916_ben_goertzel|OR YOU CAN HAVE NURROW LIKE NOTES AND LYNX YOU CAN ALSO HAVE
916_ian_hutchinson|PARADOXICAL SENSE ITS ALSO AN AMAZING FREEDOM
916_manolis_kellis|PUMPING ENERGY TO IT
917_françois_chollet|IN GENERAL I THINK IT'S QUITE LIKELY YOU KNOW THAT THERE IS
917_richard_karp|ACCOUNTING THE NUMBER OF SOLUTIONS TO SOTHAT SATISFY A PARTICULAR
917_sheldon_solomon|AN EMBODIED ONE
918_dileep_george|AH AND THE
918_françois_chollet|A LIMIT TO HIG INTELLIGENCE
918_grant_sanderson|IKE HAVE AN ACTUAL EXPLANATION FOR WHAT'S GOING ON NOT JUST A
918_ian_hutchinson|BETTER WAY TO END IT WE STARTED WITH FUSION ENERGY AND ENDING ON LOVE
918_matt_botvinick|SMADE UP OF ADOMS THAT WERE FORGED IN THE HEARTS OF COUNTLESS
918_richard_karp|FORMULA AND PROPOSITIONAL CALICPROPOSITIONAL LOGIC R PARTICULARLY SO SOMSOMSOMA
919_ben_goertzel|MANY DIFFERENT TYPES OF SEMANTICS WHICH MEANS YOU COULD MAKE A HORRIBLE UGLY MESS OR YOU COULD MAKE A SYSTEM
919_dileep_george|THAT ASPECT OF IT
919_ian_hutchinson|YEN THERE'S A HUGE ON OVE TALK TO YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOU TIME TO AX IT WAS A PLEASURE
919_manolis_kellis|ALL OF THE EUXILIARYSELF
920_ben_goertzel|WERE THESE DIFFERENT TYPES OF KNOWLEDGE ALL INTERPENETRATE AND CYNERGIZE WITH EACH OTHER
920_françois_chollet|YEAVE LAST TIME I THINK WE TALKED I THO YO HAD THIS IDEA O THAT A WE'RE ONLY AS INTELLIGENCE AS THE PROBLEMS WE FACE
920_grant_sanderson|PROBABLY CORRECT INTUITIVE UNDERSTANDING OF JUST THIKE WE SAID THAT FEW A FEW LAYERS CRATING ABSTRACTIONS
920_manolis_kellis|ALL OF THE MUNCELLS
920_richard_karp|O AVERSION OF THE SATISFIABILITY PROBLEM
921_dileep_george|CREATES A KIND OF URGENCY GOT A
921_sheldon_solomon|HER CREATOR
922_ben_goertzel|WHAT TO YOU IS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL ASPECT OF OPEN KAG
922_dileep_george|FOR US FOR HUMAN SHERE FOR HUMENCE YES AH AND THAT THAT IS PART OF OUR DRIVES
922_sara_seager|WHAT WOULD BRING YOU JOY IF WE DISCOVERED
922_sheldon_solomon|HAS MADE HER

924_dileep_george|WHO WUD Y TA BOLD
924_ian_hutchinson|EVEN JUST VISITING
924_russ_tedrake|INTRODUCED NEW CHALLENGES
924_sara_seager|LIKE PLANET AROUND A SUNLIKE STAR KNOWING THAT THERE'S AT LEAST ONE OR MORE OUT THERE
925_françois_chollet|THEY ARE TRYING TO FIX ONE SPECIC BATTONECK IN IN HUMAN MISSION COGNITION WHICH IS
925_grant_sanderson|MY ONLY POINT WOULD BE THAT
925_manolis_kellis|OF ORGANISMS THAT DIED
925_richard_karp|FORMULAS
925_russ_tedrake|SCREW SOMETHING UP MAYBE BUT I THINK ALSO WILL INVENT OURSELVES OUT OF THOSE CHALLENGES AND
926_ben_goertzel|FASCINATES ME AS
926_grant_sanderson|LIKE WHAT DIFFERENTIATES MATH
926_manolis_kellis|TO CREATE THAT YOU MEAN ON THE EVOLUTIONARY PATH AND THE EVOLUTIONARY PRACT OF HUMANS
926_richard_karp|AND HE WANT TO
926_russ_tedrake|WIFE WILL GO ON SAY IT'S INSHNINK AUSE YOU YOU DIDN'T MENTION LIKE THIS IS TECHNICALLY TOO HARD
926_sheldon_solomon|N N ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
927_dileep_george|LET ME ASK YOU AM
927_grant_sanderson|I THINK TO A LARGE EXTENT IS THAT AM THE PATTERN RECOGNITION ISN'T SUFFICIENT
927_richard_karp|NUMBER OF
927_russ_tedrake|I DON'T THINK ROBOTS ARE I THINK PEOPLE ATTRIBUTE A ROBAT THAT LOOKS LIKE AN ANIMAL AS MAY BE HAVING A LEVEL OF SELF AWARENESS
927_sara_seager|WE'LL CONTINUE AFTER I'M GONE
928_dileep_george|PEOPLE OFTEN CIN A WONDER
928_ian_hutchinson|CONNECTED ME ON TWITTER AND LEXFRIEDMAN
928_richard_karp|SOLUTIONS THAT SATISFY
929_françois_chollet|I WOULD SAY THAT HUMANS AFTER THE EVENT OF WORCEPAEDIA
929_grant_sanderson|R NOT
929_richard_karp|AH AT LEAST ONE OF THE FORMULAS
929_sheldon_solomon|AND THAT IS IS THAT NECESSARY
930_ben_goertzel|ABSTRACT
930_dileep_george|TECHNICAL FICTION PHILOSOPHICAL WEREON
930_françois_chollet|MUCH MORE INTELLIGENT YES THI THINK THAT'S THE GOOD ONE WITH A THAT'S ALL SONOT ABOUT THAT'S ABOUT AN
930_grant_sanderson|LIIKE THE ENGOLLS BUT INSTEAD THERE
930_ian_hutchinson|WITHOUT THE LETTER E
930_sheldon_solomon|FOR AN A I
931_dileep_george|I DEFINITELY LIKED AR JUDEAPOLL'S BOOK OR PROBABLISTIC REASENING AND INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS
931_grant_sanderson|THEY ARE THE LITTLE BITS AND PATS THAT GET YOU TO THE ANGELL
931_manolis_kellis|PEOPLE WHO LISTEN TO THIS ARE TAKING A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT PATH
932_dileep_george|DEEP TECHNICAL BOOK BUT WHAT I LIKE THIS THAT AND SO THERE ARE MANY OR PLACES WHERE YOU CAN LEARN ABOUT
932_françois_chollet|A ALL INTELLIGENCE TIA AR
932_grant_sanderson|IS IT THAT'S ONLY TRUE FROM MATHEMATICS IN GENERAL IT IS AN INTERESTING QUESTION IF THAT MY
932_manolis_kellis|TO THAT INORMATION TRASPER
932_sara_seager|EARTHS ARE HARD
932_sheldon_solomon|ITING IS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY A
933_ben_goertzel|CAN HELP EACH OTHER OUT LIKE WHAT YOU WANT IS
933_ian_hutchinson|AS CONTRIBUTED TO YOUR PEACE OF MIND
933_manolis_kellis|YET THROUGH LANGUAGE
933_richard_karp|OF THE FACT THAT THAT
933_russ_tedrake|SO IN THAT SENSE IT'S TOO HEART
933_sara_seager|BUT THERE ARE THERE'S ANOTHER CATEGORY OF PLANET STAR TYPE THAT'S EASIER AND THESE ARE PLANETS
934_dileep_george|O THAT WAS IN HIS LATER BOOK SO THIS WAS THE THE FIRST BOOK PROBABLISTIC RESTENING IN INTOLENT SYSTEMSKI MENTIONS CAUSALITY
934_françois_chollet|A BRANCOMPTUR ANTITHESIS RIGHT BUT THE QUESTION IS WHETHER
934_grant_sanderson|IT MIGHT NOT BE TRUE LIKE YOU MIGHT
934_richard_karp|SOLUTION MIGHT BE COUNTED MANY TIMES IF IT SOLVES
934_russ_tedrake|UM YOU KNOW TERE ARE MANY SCAREY THINGS IN THE WORLD RIGHT SO I THINK
934_sara_seager|ORBITING SMALL RED DWARF STARS
934_sheldon_solomon|MAKING THAT END
935_ben_goertzel|JUST TO AID AND ANY KIND OF INSIDES YOU CAN GIVE ON A ON OF TYPES YEH YES SO THIS THIS
935_dileep_george|BUT HE HADN'T REALLY SUNK HIS TEET INTO
935_manolis_kellis|DIRECTLY TO EACH OTHER
935_sheldon_solomon|A THING THAT'S
936_ben_goertzel|VERY NIT DEGREY AND AND MATHEMATICAL OF COURSE BUT WONT ONE KEEPAR
936_russ_tedrake|HINK ABOUT THE IMPLICATIONS OF OUR WORK
937_ben_goertzel|IS SWITCHING FROM
937_manolis_kellis|IS A HUGE FUNNEL
937_richard_karp|SAMPLE FROM THE FORMULAS ACCORDING TO THE NUMBER OF SOLUTIONS THAT SATISFY
937_sheldon_solomon|IT'S NOT LIKE WE
938_ben_goertzel|PRACTICATE LOGIC TO TERM LOGIC
938_manolis_kellis|WHICH THEN YOU RECEIVE AND YOU EXPAND
938_sara_seager|AND AND OR YOU WOULD RECOMMEND BESIDES OF COURSE YOUR BOOK
939_ben_goertzel|WHAT IS PREDICAL LOGIC WHAT IS TERM LOGIC
939_richard_karp|IN THAT WAY YOU DRAW A RANDOM SOLUTION BUT THEN YOU CORRECTS BY LOOKING AT
939_russ_tedrake|SCARES YOU BOUT OUR FUTURE WIT AAI AN AND ROBOTS A LOT OF FOLKS
939_sara_seager|THERE'S ONE BOOK I WISH EVERYONE COULD READ
939_sheldon_solomon|THAT FEELS REALLY IMPORTANT IMPLEMENT AGAIN VERY DIFFICULT
940_françois_chollet|MAY BE YOU KNOW YOU SAID THIS THE SPEED OF THE THOUGHT SO ME I I THINK I
941_dileep_george|IT WAS A
941_manolis_kellis|IN MANY WAYS
941_richard_karp|AND DON'T DOUBLE COUNT
941_russ_tedrake|BECAUSE OF THE ETHOPOMORPHISM DEVANY FEARS
942_dileep_george|ITS THERE ARE MALKIPLE BOOKS ON THIS TOPIC AND ALL OF THEM ARE AGRATE IT ITS ARM
942_grant_sanderson|AND THERE' THERE'S ACTUALLY VERY GOOD EXPLANATION FOR WHAT'S GOING ON IM
942_richard_karp|SO IF YOU YOU CAN THINK OF IT THIS WASTO YOU HAVE VEIA
942_sara_seager|AUS ASCAUS IT'S VERY ACCESSIBLE
943_françois_chollet|IN O CIVIE SIVISITION ITSELF
943_grant_sanderson|UT I THINK IT'S A GOOD TEST OF WEATHER
943_sara_seager|DO WE WANT A SHARE WHAT THE STORE S WITHOUT SPOILING
944_ben_goertzel|WHEREAS IN PREDICATE LOGIC THE BASIC OPERATION IS MOTEST PONENTS LIKE A
944_dileep_george|OUR FLIGHT WAS A INO TREATED AS AN UNSULAABLE PROBLEM
944_grant_sanderson|CLEARLY ABOUT
944_manolis_kellis|BECAUSE IN YOUR MISINTERPRETATION
944_richard_karp|AND YOU WANT TO KNOW HOW MANY COLUMNS OF THAT MEAJRICS CONTAIN AT LEAST ONE ONE
945_ben_goertzel|A IMPLIES BE THERE FOR B
945_grant_sanderson|THE MECHANISTIC EXPLANATIONS OF THINGS HOW QUICKLY YOU JUMP TO THINKING IT MUST BE POWERS OF TWO
945_richard_karp|AND YOU CAN COUNT IN EACH ROW HOW MANY ONES THERE ARE
945_sheldon_solomon|I GET
946_grant_sanderson|ASE THE PROBLEM ITSELF THERE'S REALLY NO
946_manolis_kellis|YOU ARE CREATING YE INTERPRETATION THAT MIGHT ACTULY BEWEIGHED BETTER THAN WHAT I MEANT I THE FIRST PLACE
946_richard_karp|SO WHAT YOU CAN DO IS DRAW FROM THE ROSE ACCORDING TO THE NUMBER OF ONES IF A ROE HAS MORE ONES IT GETS DRUN MORE FREQUENTLY
946_russ_tedrake|HAT'S A TREND I THINK THAT
947_françois_chollet|LIKE GUILLSEARCH RENDS AND STICK BOLOVITS
947_grant_sanderson|WAY TO IF THERE CAN'T BE A GOOD WAY TO THINK ABOUT IT AS
948_ben_goertzel|THIS LINK IS BEIMPLIES SEE
948_dileep_george|D'YOU SEE TO THINK KIND OF THING WIT THE BRAIN AND OUR TRANTINGINEER INTELLIGENCE
948_françois_chollet|HERE HER
948_grant_sanderson|LIKE DOUBLING A SET BECAUSE ULTIMATELY IT DOESN'T BUT EVEN BEFORE IT STARTS TO IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT
948_manolis_kellis|MIGHT BE THE SECRET TO CREATIVITY
948_russ_tedrake|A WILD SPECULATION
949_ben_goertzel|THEN DEDUCTION BUILDS ON LIKE AIMPLIES SEA
949_françois_chollet|A HUGE PART APART WE CAN'T PROBABLY INTROSPECT
949_grant_sanderson|SCREAMS OUT AS BEING A DOUBLING PHENOMENON SO AT BEST IF IT DID TURN OUT TO BE POWERS OF TWO IT WOULD HAVE ONLY BEEN SO VERY SUBTLY
949_richard_karp|AND ONLY
949_sara_seager|IN THIS BOOK THEY PRETTY MUCH HAVE IN A SOCIETY THAT THE BOYS IN
950_grant_sanderson|AND I THINK THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN LIKE
950_manolis_kellis|YOU ONLY BOUNCE IDEAS WITH ONE PERSON
950_sheldon_solomon|YOUR WORK IN EARNEST BECKER AN AH IT'S FUNNY THAT NON O PEOPLE AR
951_ben_goertzel|THE FOCUS OF ATTENTION SHOULD  MAKE BE THE FOCUS OF ATTENTION E
951_dileep_george|THAT YOU DON'T NEED TO FLAP
951_sara_seager|AND HE BECOMES A CHOSEN ONE TO
952_grant_sanderson|IS THAT THEY THEY'LL HAVE A SENCE FROM WHAT THE PROBLEM ITSELF IS WHETHER THE PATTERN THAT THEY'RE OBSERVING
952_manolis_kellis|MISS INTERPRETATIONS THAT HAPPENED
952_russ_tedrake|THAT I MIGHT NOT EVEN BE
952_sara_seager|E LIKE A RECEIVER THE GIVERS THE OLD WISE MAN WHO
953_richard_karp|ANOTHER
953_sheldon_solomon|YLOS A FENITUDE LUNCHE WHY I THINK ATHICS ZIR
954_dileep_george|BEING AN EXPERIMENTAL NEURAL SCIENTIST MIGHT NOT BE THE VETO GO ABOART IT HEM
954_françois_chollet|AH THEY'RE ENJOYING THEY'RE ENJOYING THIS
954_russ_tedrake|SO IN THAT SENSE THE SMART PHONE IS ALREADY THE ROW BAT WE SHOULD BE AFRAID OF E
954_sara_seager|AS TA SORT OF BOY COMES OF AGENT IS CHOSEN FOR THE SPECIAL ROLE HE FINDS THE WORLD ISN'T WHAT HE EXPECTS
955_ben_goertzel|CONTEXT ON THE OTHER HAND
955_dileep_george|HILE IT MIGHT BE IT A BETTER VAY TO PURSUE IT MIGHT BE
955_françois_chollet|SO WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON NAN
955_grant_sanderson|WAS ACTIVELY ACCOMPLISHING THAT GOAL
955_manolis_kellis|AND A SER GO ON IN BRAINSTORM WITH WHAT THEY WERE SAYING BUT
955_richard_karp|IF YOU HAVE A PHENOMENON THAT OCCURS ALMOST ALL THE TIME
956_dileep_george|MORE THAN BABE CS
956_manolis_kellis|Y THE THIRD TIME IT'S NOT WHAT THEY WERE SAYING AT ALL
956_russ_tedrake|OF THE MISINFORMATION DEM
956_sheldon_solomon|THAT THEY THEMSELVES THE HUMANS DON'T KNOW HOW TO DEAL EXACT WAY ANDS SO
957_ben_goertzel|THAT MAY ANT THAT MAY DIRECT YOUR NERL COMPONENT TO THINK WET ONE I'M THINKING ABOUT E
957_grant_sanderson|FE'R LIKE A LITTLE SCIENTIST TIGGES E ADNE SA LOWLY EH IT'S AS IF AT'S A FASCINATING
957_russ_tedrake|THE MANIPULATION
957_sara_seager|IF YOU DO TAKE A STEP OUTSIDE THE BOX AND OCCASION
958_manolis_kellis|SOMETHING VERY DIFFERENT FROM WHAT I WAS SAYING AND THAT IS THE SAME KIND OF MESSINESS
959_ben_goertzel|IN TERMS OF LOGIC
959_dileep_george|YOU LEARN ABOUT CIRCUITS YOU YOU LEARN ABOUT
959_manolis_kellis|AT I AM DESCRIBING IN THE GENOM ITSELF
959_russ_tedrake|THAT THE PROMS ARE ALL THE SAME THEY ALL THER HUMAN PROMISE ESSENTIALLY
959_sara_seager|I NEVER THUGHLIKE NOW THAT YOU'RE SAYING IT I I SEE WHATYOU'RE SAYING THE BURDEN IS HUGE BUT
959_sheldon_solomon|MORE PRACTICALLY SPEAKING OF THAT ES AT AUTHOMAS VEHICLES LIKE THE WAY YOU INTERRACT WITH PEDESTRIANS
960_ben_goertzel|HERE'S A LOT OF THOUGHT THAT WEN INTO HOW DO YOU BREAK DOWN
960_dileep_george|ON STICKS THAT  KAT TO
960_manolis_kellis|SOR OF EMBRACING THE MECINES
960_richard_karp|THAT COMES UP IN SOLVING
961_dileep_george|O IF YOU WANT TO GO TO COMMERE SCIENCE OR NUR SCIENCE IFT IT SETS A GOOD STEP THAT I'LL SIDE
961_françois_chollet|OF HUMAN JUDGES AND THESE HUMAN JUDGES
961_manolis_kellis|AGAIN TUNES TO THE UNIVERSE THAT WE INHABIT
961_russ_tedrake|MASSIVE I DO'T KNOWIF THEY SHOULD BE SCARED OF IT OR SUDGO WITH HA FLOE BUT A
961_sara_seager|YE MANY IS A VERY HUMAN INSTINCT BUT A IT IS ALSO THE BUKANA
961_sheldon_solomon|NAV WATCH
962_ben_goertzel|BASIC SORT OF PROPOSITIONALOGIC RELATIONS AS ARISTOTYLIAN TERM LOGIC DEALS WITH AND THEN
962_grant_sanderson|AMAZING THINGS YOU'VE DONE FOR THE WORLD IS
962_manolis_kellis|HAVE TO EMBRACE THE BREAKING YOU HAVE TO EMBRACE THE YOU KNOW HOW DO WE GET OUT OF THESE LOCAL OPTIMA
962_richard_karp|ALGEBRAIC IDENTITIES YOU YOU GET TEM
962_sara_seager|SHOWS THAT DA
962_sheldon_solomon|MT CERTAINLY A HUNDRED PLUS HOURS OF PEDESTRIAN VIDIOS
963_ben_goertzel|QUANTIFY LOGIC RELATIONS ALSO HOW DO YOU BREAK THOSE DUN
963_dileep_george|THAT'S THAT'SSO NO NO IMA ONE AR IT THAT ONE OF THE INTERESTING THINGS
963_françois_chollet|IN A PHILOSOPHICAL DISCUSSION IN IS IN IS
963_grant_sanderson|SOME DEGREE OPEN SOURCING THE TOOLING THAT YOU USED TO MAKE YOUR VIDIOS WITH MADAM
963_russ_tedrake|THE FIRST THING TO WORRY ABOUT ANDY I DO WANT IT JUST ASAS A KIND OF COMMENT
963_sara_seager|IT HAS AN EFFECT ON YOU
964_ben_goertzel|ELEGANT WAYS OF
964_dileep_george|ABOUT I MEAN THIS IS CHANGING THE WORLD IS CHANGING A
964_françois_chollet|AND NINETEEN FIFTY PAPER HE WAS TRYING TO
964_manolis_kellis|THAT HAVE MADE DEEP LEARNING SO SUCCESSFUL ARE WAYS TO GET AWAY FROM THAT
964_sara_seager|AND IS IT IT'S A REALLY INTERESTING QUESTION ABOUT OUR SOCIETY ANDTAKING STEP BOTLE
965_ben_goertzel|SORT OF HIROCICALLY BREAKING DOWN
965_françois_chollet|ONGYOU THAT
965_sheldon_solomon|BEING ABLE TO CONSTRUCT AN EFFECTIVE MODEL
966_richard_karp|THERERE MANY WAYS FOR THE TWO TO DISAGREE
966_russ_tedrake|CURIOSITY AND
967_richard_karp|AS HE SAID
968_dileep_george|YOU CAN ORGANIZE THAT YOU CAN FIND ALL KINDS OF THINGS IN THE DATA AND THEN YOU CAN ALSO FOR THE APPROPRIATE SCIENCES BUILD SYSTEMS THAT
968_françois_chollet|INCENTIVES THAT IT CREATES
968_russ_tedrake|I COMPLETELY AGREE I THINK BOTENDYNAMOCS IS ABSOLUTELY
968_sheldon_solomon|CAN BE HONEST ENOUGH TO SAY THAT IT'S I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO FIGURE OUTS
969_françois_chollet|AR INCENTIS
969_grant_sanderson|TWISTING IT AGUAS IS THE TERM
969_richard_karp|CAUSE YOU MAYBE COMMENT ON
969_russ_tedrake|ABSOLUTELY COMPLETELY AGREE
969_sheldon_solomon|HOW TO ENGINEER ANY OF THESE THINGS RIH
970_ben_goertzel|WOULD SAY LOGIC SYSTEMS GIVE
970_grant_sanderson|HOW WOULD YOU RECOMMEND
970_manolis_kellis|AS WHAT HER BRAIN DOES
970_richard_karp|AND WHAT WHAT ARE THE CHALLENGES THERE
971_ben_goertzel|TRANSPARENCY AND CCOMPREHENSIBILITY
971_françois_chollet|A SANSVI CRISACH
971_russ_tedrake|ODIX COMPANY'S FAIL
971_sara_seager|N THE WHOLE  ALMOST LIKE A POLITICAL THING BUT YOU KNOW WE AR WE UNDER VALUE TEACHERS
971_sheldon_solomon|THAT IAVE RUMBUSES OF ROBAT YES AAM
972_manolis_kellis|AND YET NOT TAUGHT IN SCHOOLS
972_richard_karp|AN ALGRITHM IS ALWAYS GOOD THAT'S FINE
972_russ_tedrake|HOW HARD IT IS TO MAKE MONEY WITH THE ROBATUS COMPANY LIKE
973_dileep_george|THINK ABOUT ANYTHING BIGGER THAN THAT
973_françois_chollet|A TO CONVINCE E PANEL OF HUMAN JUDGES
974_dileep_george|YOI THINK SO BECAUSE IT'S BITS BYSICLY BEING ABLE TO
974_françois_chollet|THE DEATH TALKING TO HUMAN THEN
974_grant_sanderson|THAT I CAN ANSWERSO
974_russ_tedrake|HOMER BOUGHT HIS COMPANIES LIKE GA GIBO AN
975_dileep_george|UNDERSTAND THE MISSIONERY OF THE WORLD OH
975_richard_karp|THAT THE SOLUTION IS NOT ALWAYS GOOD
975_sara_seager|PICTURE A SCIENTIST
975_sheldon_solomon|YOU AMELY ENTEMORIFI ATUATELY
976_grant_sanderson|IT'S LIKE A MATH TEACHER WHO PUT TOGETHER SOME CODE
976_manolis_kellis|AS POR OUR DISCUSSION WITH COMPUTERS AND BIOLOGICAL SYSTEMS TO CONNECT THET TWO E'S TRYING TO IN A CONNECT OUR BRAIN
976_russ_tedrake|ONQI
976_sara_seager|ND WHEN YOU PICTURE A SCIENTISTS YOU PROBABLY DON'T
977_ben_goertzel|TO YOUR TERM LOGIC LIKE FAST ENOUGH AND WITHOUT
977_grant_sanderson|PEOPLE ASKED WHAT IT WAS SO THEY MADE AT OPEN SOURCE AND THEY KEPT SCRAPPING IT TOGETHER
977_sara_seager|WOMEN AND WOMEN OF COLOR IN THIS FILM
977_sheldon_solomon|OF THE HUMAN EXPERIENCE AND THAT THERE'S THERE'S SOMETHING IN THAT THAT SHOULD BE ENGENIORED IN AR
978_ben_goertzel|HAVING A BLOATED LOGIC EXPRESSION OIT SO THERE IS JUST A LOT OF
978_russ_tedrake|I WENT DOWN
978_sheldon_solomon|IN OUR SYSTEMS TEY FEELS LIKE
979_manolis_kellis|YO THINK THE IS I'M
979_richard_karp|THE MOMENT THEIR THEIR WORST CASE IS SHOWN TO BE BAD BRIGHT AN IN IN THAT'S UNFORTUNATE I THINK WIH YOU
980_françois_chollet|AT TO PASS AS YOU NEED TO CONVINCE
980_richard_karp|A GOOD EXAMPLE IS A GOING BACK TO THE SATISFIABILITY PROBLEM A
980_sheldon_solomon|I MAY NOT AGAIN AT SOUNDS BUT
981_dileep_george|SUBSCRIBED ON YOU TO REVIEW THE FIVE STARS AN APOPA CAS
981_françois_chollet|NO DAVID COPPERFIELD COULD COULD A CHIVET IN HIS IN HIS SHOWED VIGOR STRIND BUT
981_russ_tedrake|OH I THINK M
982_dileep_george|PORAN PATRIAN A CONNECT WITH ME ON TWITTER
982_françois_chollet|IS AND WHAT IS DOING IS VERY ELABORATE
982_grant_sanderson|THAT IT STILL JUST KONDED LIKE A WORK IN PROCESS UM
982_manolis_kellis|WE  KNOW THEREIS NO DOUBT THAT WE CAN UNDERSTAND MORE AND MORE ABOUT WHAT GOES ONLY THE BRAIN
982_richard_karp|WHICH IN PRACTICE
982_russ_tedrake|CAN'T JUST LOOK AT THE FAILURES YOU CANALL I MEAN VOSELENAMACS'S SUCCESS OR LOTS OF COMPANIES THAT ARE STILL DOING AMAZINGLY GOOD EM WORK IN ROBATICS
982_sheldon_solomon|CONSIDERATION OF
983_ben_goertzel|EACH NOTE HAD ITS OWN PROCESSING SO LIKE THAT THERE
983_dileep_george|ALEX FREEDMAN
983_manolis_kellis|AND WE KEN TERUF TRAIN THE BRAIN I DON'T IF YOU REMEMBER THE PAM PILOT
983_russ_tedrake|I MEAN THIS IS THE ACTHIS IS THE
983_sheldon_solomon|WHO STARTED OUT WITH THE SACX DOLLS
984_ben_goertzel|AN EVOLUTIONARY LOANING
984_sheldon_solomon|BUT IT TURNED INTO A RELATIONSHIP
985_ben_goertzel|BUT WE HADN'T DONE ENOUGH FOR THE MAT
985_dileep_george|AND NOW LET ME LEAVE YOU WITH SOME WORDS FOR MARCHUS AURALIUS
985_grant_sanderson|STUFF EYE WORK ON AN
985_russ_tedrake|PUSH EACH OTHER FORWARD AND MANY OF THEM FAIL AND SOME OF THEM GET THROUGH AND THAT SORT OF THE NATURAL
985_sheldon_solomon|OF ENDURING SIGNIFICANCE THAT THE WOMAN WHO WROTE THE BOOK IS NOT WILLING TO DISMISS AS A PERVERSION
986_grant_sanderson|NOT LIKE DEVIATE
986_russ_tedrake|AN LA OF THINGS SWAY OF THOSE THINGS I DON'T KNOW THAT
986_sara_seager|BY NOT BEING ABLE TO THINK OUTSIDE OF HOW WE'RE ALL SEREOTYPING EACH OTHER
987_françois_chollet|TERE THAT AMY AN JUSTICAN A COMMENTED AM A LITTLE BE SURPRISE
987_grant_sanderson|AH AND JUST LIKE ACTUALLY FOSTERING THAT COMMUNITY IN A WAY THAT I HAVE BEEN LIKE SHAMEFULLY NEGLECTL OF
987_manolis_kellis|SCRIBBLE THAT WAS UNIQUE THAT THE MACHINE COULD UNDERSTAND
987_richard_karp|THE INSTANCES THAT PEOPLE FORMULATE
987_sara_seager|SO IT'S IT'S IT'S HARD TO KIND OF CONVEY THAT AND YOU CAN JUST SAY OH YE I WNT TO BE MORE DY VERSE I WANT TO BE MORE OPEN BUT
988_françois_chollet|OW LITTLE
988_grant_sanderson|I'VE JUST ALWAYS GUILTY IF IT COMES UP
988_richard_karp|IN DESIGNING DIGUAL CIRCUITS OR OTHER APPLICATIONS
988_russ_tedrake|BUT I THINK IT'S HEALTHY AND GOOD TO HAVE AM
988_sheldon_solomon|PEOPLE JOKE ABOUT SEX ROBOTS BUT IF YOU ACTUALLY LOOK HOWSEX ROBOTS WHICH ARE PRETTY RARE THESE DAYS YE ARE USED THEY'RE NOT
989_grant_sanderson|SO LET'S PUT THAT GILT ASIDE A COUNRYS EN LIKE GISENLEY  A PRETEND LIKE IT ISN'T TERRIBLE FOR SOMEONE LIKE REST A
989_sheldon_solomon|IN THE FACE OF DEATH IT FEELS LIKE WERE
990_grant_sanderson|MAKE SURE THAT WHAT YOU'RE ANIMATING SHOULD BE DONE SO PROGRAMATICALLY CAUSE A LOT OF THINGS MAYBE SHOULDN'T AM
990_manolis_kellis|SO THE FIRST HUMAN BRAIN INTERFACES WILL BE
990_richard_karp|SATISFIABILITY IS NOT HARD TO CHECK
990_russ_tedrake|CERTAINLY THAT'S THE RESEARCH MONTRE  RIGHT IF HERE
990_sheldon_solomon|YELON SO YOU KNOW THE WHAT DREW ME TO THE EXTENTIAL
991_françois_chollet|BUT LIKE MOST ENGINEERS ARE NOT REALLY INSPIRED BY IT
991_manolis_kellis|RICKING HUMANS TO SPEAK  MASCENE LANGUAGE
991_russ_tedrake|SUCCEEDING AT EVERY PROBLEM YOU ATTEMPT AN YOUR NUT
991_sara_seager|I WENT TO THIS BIG DIS LIKE EIGHT HUNDRED PEOPLE LARGE CONFERENCE CALL US
992_françois_chollet|BEING VERY HUMAN LIKE BEING INDISTINGUISHABLE FROM A HUMAN IS ACTUALLY DEVERY LAST STEP
992_grant_sanderson|FITZOGRAPHICAL INTUITION THAT AYBE HAS A LITTLE MOTION TO IT
992_richard_karp|IN PRACTICE
992_russ_tedrake|CHOOSING AGGRESSIVELY ENOUGH
993_ben_goertzel|REPRESENTATION
993_sheldon_solomon|ABOUT EXISTENTIALISM AND THEIR LIKE LOOK AT IT
994_françois_chollet|HE EYED AT WHICH WAS STRONG
994_manolis_kellis|NATURAL LIMPS WHEN THEY FIRST GROW UP
994_sara_seager|AND HAD ACTUALLY CHANGED MY LIFE
995_françois_chollet|A JARSATION
995_manolis_kellis|SY YOU HAVE THESE YOU KNOW NIOTTINY PERIOD
995_richard_karp|SO JUST REFRESH OUR MEMORIES ARE THE PROBLEM IS YOU'VE GOT HE SET OF CITIES YOU HAVE
996_ben_goertzel|THE TYPES OF KNOWLEDGE YOU NEED FOR DIFFERENT TYPES OF LEARNING LIKE DECLARATIVE PRECEDRAL ATTENTIONAL AND HOW DO YOU MAKE THESE TYPES OF KNOWLEDGE
996_françois_chollet|I A INA INA
996_grant_sanderson|DIRECTION IN MY DIRECTION
996_richard_karp|PEIRWYS DISTANCES BETWEEN CITIES
996_sheldon_solomon|HAT IS A FOUR UNIVERSAL CONCERNS THE OVERRIDING ONE IS ABOUT DEATH
997_ben_goertzel|REPRESENT IN A WAY THAT ALLOWS
997_manolis_kellis|TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO EVEN MAKE YOUR OWN CONNECTIONS BEFORE YOU'RE BORN
997_russ_tedrake|I WONDER WHET YOUR KISS WOULD THINKABLE I I ACTUALLY AN
997_sheldon_solomon|NEXT IS
998_françois_chollet|A IMPLEMENTUMEN LIKE BROAD CONNITIABILITIES THEY WILL NOT ACTUALLY BE ABLELOOK ANYTHING A LIKE HUMENS
998_manolis_kellis|AND THEN LEARNING SOUNDS IN UTURO OF YOU KNOW ALL KINDS OF ECHOES AND
998_richard_karp|BUT PEOPLE USING INTOGE PROGRAMMING
999_françois_chollet|SHOW YOUR INCONVERSATION SHOW YOUR ABILITY TO ADJUST
999_grant_sanderson|BUT ALSO MAKE SURE THAT IAM
999_manolis_kellis|INO EVENTUALLY
999_russ_tedrake|OF HUMAN CONNECTION
1000_sara_seager|AND HE WROTE THIS BOOK MAYBEING THE FORTIES OR FIFTIES ABOUT A TRIP HE TOOK IN THE LATE NINETEEN THIRTIES
1000_sheldon_solomon|THINKS ABOUT CONSCIOUSNESS THE AND THE LAST ONE IS MEANINGLESSNESS BUT THE EXSTENTIAL ISOLATION POINT
1001_ben_goertzel|WEB MINES SINCE AMID
1001_grant_sanderson|IS PROGRAMMATIC Y OVE LOUPS YEAVE CONDITIONALS YOU HAVE ABSTRACTION
1001_sheldon_solomon|IS YOU KNOW
1002_ben_goertzel|MID NINETEEN NONDIS NOW DISAPPOINTINGLY TO ALL OF US
1002_manolis_kellis|AND EVENTUALLY THEY FIGURE OUT HOW TO TRAIN THEIR ED DETECTIVES THEY WORK THROUGH THE SECOND LAYER OF THE VISUAL CORTIX AND THE THIRD LAYER AND SOM SO FOURTH AND
1002_richard_karp|GEOMETRIC INSTANCES OF THE PROBLEM WHERE THE CITIES ARE LET SAY POINTS IN THE PLAIN
1003_sara_seager|HE CALLED THE BOOK
1004_ben_goertzel|N ANANINAGIO SYSTEMER N I MEAN WE'VE USED THIS SYSTEM
1004_françois_chollet|YOU'RE AN OBSERVER YOU CAN'T
1004_russ_tedrake|NOW THERE'S SOMETHING THAT HUMANS SEEM TO DO OR MAYBE MY
1005_françois_chollet|THAT THAT' SAID YOUR AT THE SAME TIME A
1005_grant_sanderson|THINGS OF LIKE ARBITRARILY INCREASING COMPLEXITY THAT'S THE STUFF THAT'S LIKE MEANT TO BE ANIMATED PROGRAMATICALLY
1005_richard_karp|COMPUTE A MONTHS TO SOLVE A PROBLEM OF THAT SIZE BUT FOR PROBLEMS OF SIZE A THOUSAND OR TWO IT'LL RAPIDLY GET
1005_sheldon_solomon|YOU ARE FUNDAMENTALLY ALONE
1006_françois_chollet|I INITIOLY WANTED AN OCTIST
1006_manolis_kellis|NOW TAKE ANOTHER BREAD AND THINK WHAT MUSSLES REFLECTS
1006_richard_karp|OPTIMAL SOLUTIONS PROVABLY OPTIBAL SOLUTIONS
1006_russ_tedrake|I THINK WE ARE ABLE TO
1006_sara_seager|AND I JUST THOUGHT MYSELF WOW LIKE
1006_sheldon_solomon|AND BECAUSE
1007_ben_goertzel|REBUILDED THE SYSTEM TUPONA
1007_françois_chollet|OF ATTAMPTS
1007_sara_seager|HAT YOU COULD JUST TAKE THE SUMMER OFF AND EXPLORE BY CANOE AND GO AND SEE WASOUT THERE
1008_ben_goertzel|WERE STICKING WITH THE SAME BASIC ARCHITECTURE
1008_grant_sanderson|RIGHT UM YOU BE A LOT SIMPLER
1008_richard_karp|THAT IS UNLIKELY TO THAT THE THE CHEVELLING SALES BHEN PROBLEM CAN BE SOLVED IN PAULOM OM IL TINE WH
1008_sara_seager|AND IT LED TO ME JUST A DOING THAT THAT VERY THING OF COURSE IT'S DIFFERENT NOW BUT GOING OUT TO WHERE THE ROAD ENDS
1009_ben_goertzel|WE'RE TRYING TO BUILD EM WHAT WE'VE LEARNED AND WHAT ONE THING WE'VE LEARNED IS THA
1009_grant_sanderson|AH TRY TO FIND A WORK FLOW THAT DISTILLS DOWN THAT WHICH SHOULD BE PROGRAMATIC INTO MANUM AND THAT WHICH DOESN'T NEED TO BE
1010_richard_karp|S VERY DIFFICULT SO
1010_sara_seager|GO DOWN THI RIVER RIVERS WITH RAPIDS AND TRAVEL OVER LAKES AND PORTAGES AND JUST REALLY LIVE
1010_sheldon_solomon|LANGUAGE IS OF PALE SHADOW
1011_ben_goertzel|DEPENDENT TYPES TO BE MUCH FASTER AND AMONG PROBLISTIC DEPENDENT TYPES TO BE MUCH FASTER SO AS IT IS NOW
1011_richard_karp|AFTER I DID MY ORIGINAL WORK ONNO
1012_richard_karp|GETTING CUR
1013_ben_goertzel|LIKE WEWENT TYPES TO BE FIRST CLASS CITIZENS
1013_grant_sanderson|O MOST ENDLEAST
1013_richard_karp|SHOWING ALL THESE PROBLEMS THREE AND PE COMPLETE
1013_sara_seager|HEY WERE SCARY ELEMENTS ABOUT OF IT OUT OFET HEMBE
1014_françois_chollet|I REDUCE THE UNCERTAINTY YES IT'S HALF FAST WE
1014_grant_sanderson|I MEAN I LOVE THAT IT'S LIKE
1014_sheldon_solomon|YOU COULD BE TRYING DESPERATELY TO CONVEY YOUR THOUGHTS AND FEELINGS
1015_ben_goertzel|ABOLIC SYSTEM BECAUSE
1015_françois_chollet|IS THE EFFICIENCY WITH WHICH REDUCED CERTAINTY IN IMPROBEM SPACE EXAR
1015_grant_sanderson|OBJECT ORIENTED AND FUNCTIONAL I GUESS THAT YOU CAN CAN OF LIKE
1015_russ_tedrake|HUMANS AND ANIMALS BEHAVE AND TAT'S JUST
1015_sara_seager|II WAS TO GO OUT THERE AND HAVE LIVE ON THE EDGE SAID PERSEVERE
1016_grant_sanderson|GET BOTH OF THOSE AM
1016_sara_seager|PERSEVERIA A DIVE ADVICE THAT YOU WOULD GIVE TO A YOUNG PERSON TO DAY
1017_ben_goertzel|AND TORCH KEEPS A A SORT OF
1017_russ_tedrake|KAN YOU SAY WHAT DOES IT TAKE TO CONTROL ABOUT
1017_sara_seager|ETAN
1018_françois_chollet|I MEAN WHAT YOUR DOING WHAT YOU'VE DONE WITH THE ARC CHALLENGES IS A BRILLIANT I'M ALSO NOT I'M SURPRISED THAT IT'S NOT MORE POPULAR
1018_richard_karp|SO I ASSUMED FOR EXAMPLE THAT IF WE WERE GENERATING A GRAFF
1018_russ_tedrake|WHAT IS THE CONTROL PROBLEM OFA ROBAT
1018_sara_seager|WOULD LIKE TO HELP YOU MAY BE
1019_ben_goertzel|AND WANTING MUCH MORE EFFICIENT INTEROPERATION BETWEEN THE COMPUTATION GRAFTS OF DEEP NURL NUT FRAMEWORKS AND OPENCOX HYPROGRAPH AND
1019_grant_sanderson|AH I MEA THE BIGGEST DISADVANTAGES THAT IT'S SLOW SO WHEN YOU'REDOING COMPUTATIONALLY INTENSIVE THINGS

1045_manolis_kellis|BUT BABIES DON'T DO THAT BABIES HAVE TO FIGURE IT OUTS AND YOU KNOW SOME OF IT IS HAR COTED BUT SOME OF THE MONEYS ACTUALLY LEARNED
1045_richard_karp|ZOO OF DIFFERENT
1045_sara_seager|CLICKED THE LYNX IN THE DESCRIPTION TO GET A DISCOUNT IT'S THE BEST WAY TO SUPPORT THIS PODCAST
1045_sheldon_solomon|SO THAT YOU CAN GET GRANTS
1046_ben_goertzel|AND THAT AS AN ANTOF PREMER I CAN SEE MANY HIGHLY VALUABLE USES FOR THEM AND AS
1046_grant_sanderson|THAT'S AN ADMIRABLE ASPECT OF LEADERSHIP
1046_manolis_kellis|UNIQUE IN EVERY SINGLE NEW PERSON
1046_richard_karp|GRAFTS THAT HE COULD CHOOSE FOR OM ENT HE OULD STUDY THE PERFORMANCE OF ALGRYTHMS ON DIFFERENT TYPES OF GRAFTS AND A
1046_sheldon_solomon|THAT'S CERTAINLY TRUE BUT THERE'S ALSO A KIND OF A BEHAVIOUR THING YOU SAID LIKE LONG HAIR THERE'S A
1048_françois_chollet|I WAS INVESTING FOR INSTANCE AM IF I LOOK AT THE BAST
1048_grant_sanderson|HIS PHYSIC'S PROJECT WHICH HIS KIND OF THE HYPOGRAPH VIEW OF A THEORY OF EVERYTHING DYOU ARE
1048_manolis_kellis|ABSOLUTELY AND VERY VERY YOU KNOW AH HOPEFUL THAT WE CAN HAVE MACHINES THAT READ
1048_sara_seager|SPELLED I'M NAT SURE HOW
1049_françois_chollet|A A UN A TWENTY YEARS IF STUCK MARKET DATA
1049_russ_tedrake|SO ANEROPLANE IS OF EXTREMELY COMPLEX SYSTEM OR A SPACE CRAFT LANDING WHATEVER
1049_sara_seager|TYPING STUFFIN UNTIL YOU GET TO THE GUY
1049_sheldon_solomon|GLORIFY
1050_ben_goertzel|WI WI ERE E HAVEN'T LAUNCHE LANCH YET BUT SO  THINK IT'S COOL
1050_manolis_kellis|NOWHERE I MEAN I THINK LANGUAGE WILL STEAL THE
1050_russ_tedrake|UT AT LEAST IT HAS THE LUXURY OF AM
1051_ben_goertzel|MUNOTE DO NOT UNDERSTAND ES AT RECOGNIZING A LARGE NUMBER OF
1051_grant_sanderson|I NK AM
1051_richard_karp|INNA WHERE YOU SORT OF ASSUME THAT A ORTHE WORLD HAS
1051_russ_tedrake|TINGS CHANGE RELATIVELY CONTINUOUSLY
1052_françois_chollet|IS TAT STRATEGY IS STILL GOING TO BE TRUE FOR THE NEXT TWONE YEARS WELE ACTUALLY PROBABLY NOT A WHICH IS WHY
1052_grant_sanderson|OPULARIZED SCIENCES CONCERNED
1052_richard_karp|GIVEN YOU A BUNCH OF FIR
1053_françois_chollet|IF YOU'RE A SMART IN VESTO
1053_grant_sanderson|EOPLE ARE MORE INTERESTED IN THEORIES OF EVERYTHING THAN THEY SHOULD BE
1053_manolis_kellis|THEN IU NOW ONE FROM THE OTHER
1053_sheldon_solomon|YOU KNOW I CAN IMAGINE WHY AREN'T PEOPLE WHY AREN'T YOU AT A HARVARD FOR EXAMPLE ATAM AREMITE A
1054_ben_goertzel|WE TRIVED TO MIND PATTERNS OUT OF THE STRUCTURE THE TRANSFORMER NUTWORK
1054_manolis_kellis|AN YET
1054_richard_karp|AH WERE WE DON'T REALLY HAVE THAT FOR
1054_russ_tedrake|TENDS TO TAKE US CHANGE ONLY BY A SMALL AMOUNT
1055_ben_goertzel|YOU CAN BUT THE PATTERNS AREN'T WHAT YOU WANT THEY'RE THEI'R NASTY SOMENUCE IF YOU DO SUPERVISE LEARNING
1055_manolis_kellis|YE KNOW WHEN YOU'RE CHOOSING WORDS FROM A SI A LIST OF TWENTY SYNONYMS
1056_ben_goertzel|YOU LOOK AT SENTENCES WHILL YOU KNOW THE CORRECT PARS OF A SENTENCE
1056_françois_chollet|IAM IN OUR EDUCATION
1056_manolis_kellis|OU KNOW EXACTLY THE CONNOTATION OF EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM
1056_richard_karp|YOU KNOW THERE'S BEEN A HUGE GROWTH
1056_russ_tedrake|TE SANTHERS ARE CLOD ANGACHANISM
1057_ben_goertzel|FROM THE TRANSFORMER NETWARK'S INTERNAL STATE AND WE WE DID THIS I THINK I
1057_françois_chollet|SULAVIT IS DRIVEN BY PLAYS DRIVEN BY CURIOSITY AH
1057_richard_karp|A BIG GROWTH OF DETI SETS RALABLE DO YOU THINK
1057_sheldon_solomon|WHICH I DECLINED FOR MONTHS BECAUSE OF THE EXTRAORDINARY PRESSURE
1058_russ_tedrake|LOCALLY LIKE A LINEAR SYSTEM FOR INSTANCE I CAN USE NORLINEAR ALGEBRA TOOLS TO STUDY SYSTEMS LIKE THAT
1059_ben_goertzel|IT'S KIND OF UGLY SO WHAT WHAT WE'RE ACTUALLY DOING
1059_manolis_kellis|PERSONAL JOURNEY A I AM GOING TO PARIS FOR THE EXPLICIT PURPOSE OF A
1059_sheldon_solomon|BUT WHAT THEY TOLDME AT SKIDMWOR WAS
1060_françois_chollet|RETAINING ALL KANDS OF FIRM
1060_manolis_kellis|AH EVERYTHING O'V LEARNED ABOUT THE TRANSLATION ARE
1060_russ_tedrake|TO THESE SMOOTH SYSTEMS
1061_ben_goertzel|BUT WE'RE USING THE TRASFORM OR NORROL NUTWORK
1061_françois_chollet|FORFIJON SATEN
1061_grant_sanderson|UGHDYOU DOES NOT ACTUALLY CAN UNDERSTAND THE SUBSTANCE OF WHAT THEY ARE SAYING
1061_manolis_kellis|IT MAKES ME FEEL
1061_russ_tedrake|WHAT IS CONTACT  THE ROBAT AM
1061_sheldon_solomon|I I WAS GIVEN TEN YEA
1062_grant_sanderson|HAT I THINK HIS WAYWAY MORE PRODUCTIVE IS AM TO LET YOURSELF GET REALLY INTERESTED IN THE PHENOMENA THAT ARE STILL
1062_russ_tedrake|UNPREDICTIBLE WAYS
1063_ben_goertzel|YOU CAN GENERATE A BUNCH OF SCENTS AS USING THAT RULE OF GRAMMAR AND A BUNCH OF SCENTS IS VIOLETING THAT RULE OF GRAMMAR
1063_françois_chollet|YES SO A GOOD MODER OF THE WORLD IS GOING INCLUDE ALL KINDS OF THINGS THATATE COMPLETELY USELESS ACTUALLY JUST BECAUSE JUST IN CASE
1063_richard_karp|OR IS THAT RELIGIOUS TUSI TWO DIFFENT WORLTHS
1064_grant_sanderson|AS THE PATH TO GETTING
1064_richard_karp|AND THEY REPORT ON PERFORMANCE
1065_ben_goertzel|SO IN THAT WAY YOU CAN USE THE NURROW MODEL AS A SENSE PROBABILIE ORACLE TO GUIDE
1065_manolis_kellis|SENTENCE
1066_françois_chollet|IS NOT PRECTIVE WITH TE CHICIA
1066_richard_karp|CONVINCING
1066_russ_tedrake|UM AND I THNK THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF A
1067_russ_tedrake|HERE'S TRUTH TO THAT BUT THAT MAY BE A MISUNDERSTANDING AROUND THAT
1067_sheldon_solomon|BUT I WAS VERY LUCKY TO BE GIVEN THE LATITUDE AND TO BE ENCOURAGED
1068_manolis_kellis|AND THE WAY THAT I TEACH THEM GREEK
1068_richard_karp|IS REPRESENTATIVE OF ANYTHING AT ALL
1068_sheldon_solomon|YOUKNI AN I DON'T MEAN THIS CYNICALLY BUT WE WERE TRAINED IN A METHOD IN SEARCH OF A QUESTION
1069_ben_goertzel|THE THING IS THESE NURL NETS ARE NOT
1069_manolis_kellis|IT'S VERY INTERESTING
1069_richard_karp|IN TERMS OF BRAKTHROUGH AND OPEN PROBLEMS WHAT OR THE MOST
1069_russ_tedrake|THINK ABOUT OUR RHOBATS AND WE WRITE OUR SIMULATORS
1069_sheldon_solomon|SO I APPRECIATE
1070_grant_sanderson|LIKE THIS NOVEL THEORY OF EVERYTHING TYPE THING
1070_richard_karp|COMPELLING OPEN PROBLEMS TO YOU AND WOULD POSSIBLE BREAK THOSE YOUSEE IN THE NEAR TERM IN TERMS OF
1071_françois_chollet|A BUT
1071_sheldon_solomon|AND I ALSO APPRECIATE THAT
1072_ben_goertzel|WHICH HAVE A SYMATIC MEANING SO THAT THAT WAS A RARE CASE
1072_grant_sanderson|CERTAIN IDEAS AND IF YOU LET YOURSELF THINK PAST WHAT THE VIDIO TELLS YOU ABOUT
1072_manolis_kellis|WITHOUT UNDERSTANDING HOW IT WAS INETIALLY FORMED
1072_russ_tedrake|N THAT LEADS TO SMOTE SOME PARADOXES WHEN YOU GO TO TRY TO TALK ABOUT RIGID BODY MECHANICS AND CONTACT
1073_richard_karp|JUST MENTION ONE THING I WROTE A PAPER WITH A RICHARD LIFTON AND IN NINETEEN SEVENTY NINE
1073_russ_tedrake|IF I HAVE A THREE LEGGED STOOL
1073_sheldon_solomon|MY VIEW IS
1074_grant_sanderson|S FAR AS POPULARIZING SCIENCE IS CONCERNED
1074_manolis_kellis|IN A FROMIC SPARTS
1075_ben_goertzel|PAUSED TAT RATHER THAN GAVE IT UP WE PAUSED AT AND SEVERAL CA LETS
1075_grant_sanderson|THE AUDIENCE SHOULD BE LESS INTERESTED THAN THEY ARE IN THEORIES OF EVERYTHING
1075_richard_karp|IF YOU TAKE A PROBLEM A COMMENTORIAL
1076_ben_goertzel|LET'S TRY MORE INOVITIVE WAYS
1076_manolis_kellis|AND TWO SYNONYMS THAT THAT UD OF HAVE DIFFERENT ROOTS
1077_françois_chollet|MY AND SO AT LIST ONE OF MY ANCESTS
1077_manolis_kellis|E'LL ACTALLY HAVING PLICATIONS THAT CARRY A LOT OF THAT BAGGAGE
1077_richard_karp|AND YOU AM
1077_sheldon_solomon|HE WORE A BOTIE
1078_ben_goertzel|I WOULD DOING THAT AND
1078_grant_sanderson|AR LIKE ACTUAL PRACTISING PHYSICIS
1078_sheldon_solomon|AND THERE'S ANOTHER GUIDE DARNAL ROCKER WHO TAUGHT ME ABOUT PHILOSOPHY
1079_ben_goertzel|LANGUAGE YOU CAN DO SIMILAR THINGS THAN VISION RIGHT THOW IT WAS IT IS AN ORACLE YEA YEA OUT SO YOU CAN
1079_grant_sanderson|I MIGHT BE THE CASE MAYBE MORE PEOPLE SHOULD THINK ABOUT FUNDAMENTAL QUESTIONS
1079_manolis_kellis|BEFORE WORKING ON GENO REVOLUTION MY
1079_sheldon_solomon|AND HE WAS
1080_ben_goertzel|THAT'S ONE WAY AS YOU USE A STRUCTURE LEARNING OGRITIN WHICH IS SYMBOLIC
1080_françois_chollet|WE ALE IS THAT
1080_russ_tedrake|SO THE
1081_manolis_kellis|ENTER OF TRACING
1081_richard_karp|OF SIZE FIFTY TWO
1081_russ_tedrake|THE FORCE OF GRAVITY IS BEING COUNTERED BY THE FORCES THAT THE GROUND IS PUSHING ON MY TABLE LEGS
1081_sheldon_solomon|THE LEVEN HATCHES IN
1082_françois_chollet|A AND IT MIXES UP OURSERVES IT MIXE UP WE ARE
1082_grant_sanderson|I WOULD TALK ABOUT ON PROVING FERMA'S LAST DYRAM IN THE SPECIFIC CASE OF ANEQUALS THREE
1082_russ_tedrake|I ALSO KNOW SINCE IT'S NOT ROTATING
1083_ben_goertzel|TWEAT THE NURL NUTWORK TO
1084_françois_chollet|IS NOT ACTURE YOUR OWN
1084_richard_karp|WHERE YOU COULD FEED THE EDGES OF THE GRAFF AND UN AS BULIAN INPUTS
1085_sheldon_solomon|SOMEBODY WHO LOOKS AT YOU AND SAYS I WAT A STIFF HE'S PROBABLY AN M B A WELL THEY'RE WRONG
1086_richard_karp|AND THAT WOULD IN OTHER WORDS BRIEFLY WHAT YOU WOULD SAY IN THAT CASE IS THAT THE PROBLEM HAS
1087_françois_chollet|ON CONCEPTS AND IMAGES
1087_grant_sanderson|AND SO ANY OTHER ATTEMPT TO DESCRIBE IT WOULD JUST INTO BEING LIKE SHALLOW AND NOT REALLY PRODUCTIVE FOR THE VIEWER'S TIME
1087_manolis_kellis|MEANS SIDE BY SIDE A LAILS FROM A LEEL'S WHICH MEANS IDENTICAL TWINS
1088_ben_goertzel|OR THE SARABELUM
1088_françois_chollet|THAT YEE NOT IN VENTS
1088_russ_tedrake|SAME HEIGHT AND THERE SAT DOWN AND THE TABLES NOT MOVING
1088_sheldon_solomon|I STILL
1089_françois_chollet|AN ECO
1089_richard_karp|THESE PROBLEMS WILL HAVE SMALL CIRCUITS
1089_russ_tedrake|CONSERVATION LAWS
1089_sheldon_solomon|AND IT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY
1090_ben_goertzel|SEMATICALLY MEANINGFUL OPAQUE TANGLED REPRESENTATION AND THAT WHEN THEY INTERFACE WITH THE MORE COGNANT PARTS OF THE QARTEX THE KARTEX THE
1090_richard_karp|SMALL CIRCUITS FOR PROM OF PARTICULAR SIZE
1090_sheldon_solomon|REALLY APPREHENSIVE ABOUT FUTURE OF EDUCATION RIGHT NOW
1091_ben_goertzel|ITSTAT OF USING THOSE AS AN ORACLE AND LEARNING THE ABSTRACT REPRESENTATIONS SO IF YOU DO SPORTS SAY TAKE FOR EXAMPLE SERVING AN TENNIS RIT
1091_françois_chollet|AH BEFORE US RIGHT THAT'S WHO WE ARL
1091_grant_sanderson|SHORT OF MATURE TO APPOINT WHERE HEU REALIZED THAT AT
1091_manolis_kellis|ARE FATHOMLESS
1092_françois_chollet|IN THE SAME WAY
1093_ben_goertzel|AND I MAD I LEARNED MUSIC BY A TARAL NERATOIG I JUST SIT DOWN AND PLAY
1093_françois_chollet|IF WE MANAGE TO CONTRIBUTE SOMETHING
1093_grant_sanderson|GROW TO SEE WHAT IT FEELS LIKE FOR THESE THINGS TO BE RESOLVED RATHER THAN SPENDING YOUR BRAINCYCLES ON SOMETHING
1093_manolis_kellis|IN ARE IN THE BRAINS OF HUMANS
1093_sheldon_solomon|A NEE A LOT OF THESE AR GUGLE TYPE PEOPLE WHO I DON'T YOU KNOW THEIR GENIUSES ALSO BUT
1094_ben_goertzel|IF YOU'RE AN ATHLETE WHICH I'M NOT A GOOD ATHLETE AMN THA THEN YOU'LL WATCH VIDIOS OF YOURSELF
1094_richard_karp|I GUESS THAT SANT GELANE THAT WOULD BEAT THAT WOULD BE HARD YENT HAVE
1095_françois_chollet|AND A A AND THAT THAT'S IN A WAY THIS IS TIS A A OF PATH TO IMMOTERATO IS THAT
1095_richard_karp|DAS
1095_russ_tedrake|THE AMOUNT O FORCE THAT YOUR
1096_françois_chollet|AS WE CONTRIBUTE THINGS
1096_grant_sanderson|SO I THINK PEOPLE SHOULD GET IN THAT HABIT I THINK THE POPULARIZATION OF PHYSICS SHOULD ENCOURAGE THAT HABIT
1096_russ_tedrake|THAT THE TABLE WILL PUSH BACK IF I WERE TO NOUNCE Y TO PUSH MY TABLE SIDEWAYS I GUESS I HAVE A TABLE HERE AM
1096_sheldon_solomon|JUST TO BE IN PERSON WELL IT'S IMPORTANT TO ME I
1097_ben_goertzel|HERE'S SOMETHING IN MY HEAD
1097_françois_chollet|CALTRENTON INTEN BECOMES A FUTURE HUMENS AND
1097_russ_tedrake|IS PROPORTIONAL TO THE NORMAL FORCE
1097_sheldon_solomon|ONESTLY I WAS LI
1098_manolis_kellis|WITH ONE PERSON CREATING IT EVERYTHING TAKES MEANING IN THE RECEIVING END
1098_russ_tedrake|O IF I HAVE IF I'M VERY BARELY TOUCHING AND I PUSH I'LL SLIDE BUT IF I'M PUSHING MORE AND I PUSH IILL SLIDE LESS
1098_sheldon_solomon|IT'S NOT ABOUT OUR ENJOYMENT PER SE UM
1100_manolis_kellis|OLV THESE COMMUNICATION NETWORKS
1101_ben_goertzel|AND THEN DECLARADIVELI
1101_françois_chollet|SUM UP THE MEANING OF LIFE LIKE IN THE SEME ER THAT WE ARE
1101_grant_sanderson|TAKES A LOT OF STEPS
1101_russ_tedrake|AND YOU PUSHED THE TABLE
1102_françois_chollet|DE DE SAME
1102_richard_karp|IGH HIGH LEVEL
1103_grant_sanderson|LIKE THE MOST AM UP TO DATE
1103_richard_karp|A CLASS WHICH I COULD BRIEFLY DESCRIBE UM
1103_russ_tedrake|WHAT THE FRICTION FORCES ARE GOING TO BE
1104_françois_chollet|AND THAT'S WHY
1104_grant_sanderson|A PROGRESS ON THE RIMAND HYPOTHESIS COUSINS OR AM
1104_manolis_kellis|YET THEY ILL HAVE THE COMMON ROOT OF THE STAMSEILS THAT VE LED TO THEM
1104_richard_karp|SOMETHING STRANGE WOULD HAPPEN SO
1105_françois_chollet|YOU KNOW WE SHOULD BE DESIMS LIKE YET PERHAPS IN ANYTHING TO SAY BUT WE SHOULD BE
1106_grant_sanderson|A DISCREET FEELING FINENITE SETTINGS THAT ARE MORE WELL BEHAVED I'M NOT DESCRIBING THAT
1106_richard_karp|WE HAVE TO DEFINE THIS HIERARCHY
1106_russ_tedrake|SO THE RIGID BODY ASSUMPTION
1107_françois_chollet|EVERY ACT OF KINDNESS CRITS REPORTS AND AND IN REVERSE EVERY ACT OF VIOLENCE OR SOCREITS REPORTS AND YOU WANT YOU WANT TO
1108_ben_goertzel|MUCH BETTER THAN YOU CAN SAY WHY
1108_russ_tedrake|DO THAT SOMETIMES BECAUSE SOFT CONTACT IS
1109_grant_sanderson|ALH TO ME THAT'S WERE LIKE THE MOST SATISFYING THING IS WHEN YOU REALLY UNDERSTAND
1109_richard_karp|AND WHAT IS N P ND P INVOLVED STATEMENTS OF THE FORM THERE EXISTS ASOMETHING SUCH THAT SOMETHING
1109_russ_tedrake|POTENTIALLY HARDER NUMERICALLY OR WHATEVER AND THE BEST SIMULATORS DO BOTH OR DO SOME COMBINATION OF THE TWO
1109_sheldon_solomon|THAT THIS WAS GUN A BE
1110_grant_sanderson|EH REALLY UNDERSTAND BUILD THE HABIT OF FEELING WHAT IS LIKE TO ACTUALLY COME TO RESOLUTION
1110_manolis_kellis|DON'T EXIST IN ANY ONE
1110_richard_karp|COLES

1121_ben_goertzel|IN MACHINE LEARNING APPLID TO AUTEMNATED THEORIMPROVING ANIN PROGUE UNDER JOSEPH URBOND SO THAT THE FIRST PAPER DEEP MATH
1121_grant_sanderson|WHAT HE THINK IS
1121_manolis_kellis|YOU NEED A DIFFERENT SET OF WORDS TO EVOKE THAT SAME SET OF REACTIONS TO A FRENCH PERSON
1121_russ_tedrake|AND A IT LIVES ON CONTINUOUSANY I MEAN WAT DO
1121_sheldon_solomon|ACROSSING STREE IN FRONT OF A CAR AND A
1122_françois_chollet|THERE WERE MACHINES WHICH BORE A RESEMBLANCE TO OUR BODIES
1122_manolis_kellis|MATCHED TOO THE CULTURAL
1122_russ_tedrake|SO WHAT WE SEE MAGNON SMOOTH YEPTERE NOT ONLY NOT SMOOTH BUT THAT THIS IS DISCONTINUOUS
1123_manolis_kellis|OF THE TARGET AUDIENC THAT YOU HAVE IT THE IS IS I MEAN HERE'S JUST
1123_richard_karp|SOME AH
1123_russ_tedrake|THE NONSMOOTH COMES IN WHEN I
1124_manolis_kellis|I USUALLY DON'T THINK ABOUT THIS BUT RIGHT NOW THERE'S THIS FEELING IS A REMINDER THAT JUST YOU AND I TALKING
1125_françois_chollet|THE FIRST IS THAT THEY COULD NEVER USE WORDS OR PUT TOGETHER SIGNS AS WE DO IN ORDER TO DECLARE OUR THOUGHTS TO OTHERS
1125_grant_sanderson|I THINK LIKE MEANING
1125_manolis_kellis|BUT THERE'S SEVERAL HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE WILL LISTEN TO THIS THERE'S SOME GUY IN RUSSIA RIGHT NOW N
1126_françois_chollet|IT IS NOT CONCEIVABLE
1126_grant_sanderson|DON'T UNDERSTAND THE QUESTION
1126_manolis_kellis|AH LIKE A MOSCOW LISTENING TO US
1126_russ_tedrake|DISCONTINUOUS CHANGE IN AND VELOCITY FOR INSTANCE
1126_sheldon_solomon|SEEMINGLY EFFECTIVELY THAT ETAT DARME
1127_ben_goertzel|ONE WAY THEY WOULD DO IT WAS
1127_grant_sanderson|I THINK MEANING IS SOMETHING THAT DESCRIBED TO STUFF THAT'S CREATED WITH PURPOSE
1127_manolis_kellis|AN THEREIS SOMEBODY IN INDIA GUARANTEE THERE'S SOMEBODY IN CHINA AND SOUTH AMERICA THEREIS SOMEBODY IN TEXAS AND
1128_russ_tedrake|YOU CAN WRITE CONTROLLERS WHICH TRY TO STILL PERFORM THE RIGHT TASK
1128_sheldon_solomon|THAT WE BLAME
1129_ben_goertzel|WIRE THEM TOGETHER TO TO TO CO TRAIN AND LE  LEARN THEM TOGETHER LIKE THAT THAT WOULD BE
1129_richard_karp|DIFFERENT CASES
1130_richard_karp|WOULD GET
1130_sheldon_solomon|THE CONDITIONS ARE THE THE ENVIRONMENT BUT A
1131_manolis_kellis|I THINK THIS IS THE RIGHT TIME
1131_sheldon_solomon|THE OBRINGING OF PEOPLE LIKE PARENTS IN BOBBA LIKE THE
1132_richard_karp|GET HARDER AND HARDER LIVIN HARDER E AD HA HARTERAN HART SOLF
1132_sheldon_solomon|IS VERY ELOQUENT IN OUR CURIOUS POINTS EU SO THAT
1133_ben_goertzel|SORT OF PISSED ME OFF LIKE IT WAS IT WASN'T THER ALEC YOU KNOW IN THE HIPPO CAMPUS YOU HAVE THESE CONCEPT NERNS
1133_manolis_kellis|I'L GET TOGETHER WITH FRIENDS TO DISCUSS THE MEANING OF LIFE LET ME ASK YOU IN YOUR
1133_richard_karp|AND WHAT IT LIFTED AND EYE SHOWED WAS THAT IF THUM N P HAD SMALL CIRCUITS
1133_russ_tedrake|E WE WE WRITE IT DOWNRIGHT NOW
1133_sheldon_solomon|ME JUSHILIES MAN WE DO
1134_richard_karp|THEN THIS HIERARCHY WOULD COLLAPSE DOWN TO THE SECOND LEVEL
1134_russ_tedrake|EVERY DIFFERENT CONTROL CAN CONFIGURATION
1134_sheldon_solomon|EDUCATION IS LIKE ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT THE IS PROBABLY THE MOST IMPORTANT THING YOU IN OUR CIVILIZATION AND WE'RE DOING A SHADY JOB OF IT
1135_grant_sanderson|RELATIVE TO WHICH I MEAN YOU COULD CALCULATE THE HEIGHT
1135_richard_karp|AND OTHERWORS YOU WOULDN'T GET ANY MORE MILAGE BY COMPLICATING YOUR EXPRESSIONS WITH THREE QUANTIFIERES OR FOUR QUANTIFIERS OR ANY NUMBER
1136_ben_goertzel|WE DON'T KNOW H THA BRAINWORKS
1136_richard_karp|I'M NOT SURE WAT TO MAKE OF THAT EXACTLY WELL I THINK IT WOULD BE EVIDENCE THAT
1136_russ_tedrake|PARTS OF MY BODY THERE IN CONTACT OR NOT LOOKS LIKE A DIFFERENT SYSTEM
1137_ben_goertzel|THAT WELL WE DON'T KNOW HOW BIRDS FLY THAT WELL YET YET EITHER WE HAVE NO IDEA HOW A HUMMING BIRD FLIES AND GERMS OF THE THE ARODONAMICS OF IT ON THE OTHER HAND
1137_richard_karp|AND N P DOESN'T HAVE SMALL CIRCUITS AS  SOMETHING BECAUSE SOMETHING SO DESIRE WOULD HAPPEN
1138_grant_sanderson|THE THING THAT GIVES YOU JOY ABOUT EDUCATION ABOUT MATHEMATICS
1138_russ_tedrake|RINT SO I JUST DON'T HAVE ENOUGH TIME TO COMPUTE
1138_sheldon_solomon|AND YET E WE VALUE
1139_ben_goertzel|SO LET'S TAKE THOSE BASIC PRINCIPLES AND ENGINEER SOMETHING THAT EMBODIES THOSE BASIBASIC PRINCIPLES BUT
1139_grant_sanderson|WHAT THE HELL IS THERE
1139_russ_tedrake|ALL THE POSSIBLE CONTACT OFFIGURATIONS OF MY HUMANOID
1139_sheldon_solomon|ANY ONE OR ANYTHING MORE THAN EDUCATORS UKNOL PART OF IT IS JUST THE
1140_manolis_kellis|AND MUTUALLY SENERGISTIC AND TOGETHER FORMING A BEAUTIFUL VIEW OF WHAT IT MEANS TO BE HUMAN IN MANY WAYS
1140_russ_tedrake|INTERESTINGLY
1141_sheldon_solomon|THAT AMERICANS HAVE
1142_ben_goertzel|MAYBE THE A G I WILL HELP US DO BETTER BRAIN IMAGING THAT WILL THEN LET US BUILD ARTIFICIAL HUMANS WHICH IS VERY VERY INTERESTING
1142_grant_sanderson|IMACINS DY BRINGING OTHERS JOY SPECIALLY LIKE IN SOMETHING YOU'VE CREATED
1142_manolis_kellis|OFF THEIR LOVED ONE THEIR LIKE BARTNER FOR MANY MANY YEARS

1142_sheldon_solomon|TEACHERS FOR TEACHERS SA ALSO SIMILARLY LIKE GON
1143_ben_goertzel|YOU KNOW
1143_richard_karp|VERY DIFFERENT FROM THE THEORETICAL COMPUTER SCIENCE WORLD BECAUSE
1143_sheldon_solomon|JUST PEOPLE'S PEOPLE SERVICE I THINK GREAT TEACHERS A
1144_ben_goertzel|LATYE BY ASK ME
1144_manolis_kellis|DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PURPOSE
1145_richard_karp|T'S MORE AKIN TOO
1145_sheldon_solomon|THING IN OUR SOCIETY AND I WOULD SAY NOW IN A CONTROVERSAL NOT LIKE BLACK LIE'S MATTER A A
1146_grant_sanderson|WANT TO BE ALONE TOGETHER WITH SOME ONE I THINK WE'RE ALL ALONE TOGETHER SAD I THINK THERE'S NO BETTER WAY
1146_manolis_kellis|QUOTE ONE OF THE ANSWERS
1146_sheldon_solomon|NEIGHBORS TO
1147_grant_sanderson|THANKS FOR LISTENING TO THIS CONVERSATION WITH GRANT SANDERSON
1147_russ_tedrake|THAT'S PROBABLY IT'S PROBABLY NOT A PROBLEM I NEED TO SOLVE

1150_ben_goertzel|OP OPEN COGGIME LIST AN A THERE'S A SLACK AS WELL I'M EM WERE WIT WERE CERTAINLY INTERESTED TO HAVE A
1150_grant_sanderson|CLICKED THE SPONSOR LYNKS IN THE DESCRIPTION TO GET A DISCOUNT AND TO SUPPORT THE SPOG GAS
1150_russ_tedrake|THE SIMPLEST EXAMPLE MAY BE WOULD BE IMAGINE OF A RUBBOT WITH A FLAT FOOT
1150_sheldon_solomon|POLITICAL PRADILACTIONS
1151_grant_sanderson|SUBSCRIBED ON YOU TWO REVIEW IT WITH FIVE STARZAN UPE POTCAS
1151_manolis_kellis|AND THE FIRST INTERPRETATION IS LIKE A CHILD
1151_richard_karp|ONE IS THAT
1151_russ_tedrake|THOSE ARE EACH DIFFERENT CONTACT IN FIGURATIONS
1152_manolis_kellis|BECOME ONE YEAR OLD WITH THE EXCITEMENT OF DISCOVERING EVERYTHING ABOUT THE WORLD
1153_grant_sanderson|O CONNECTWED ME ON TWITTER ALEX FRIEDMAN
1153_russ_tedrake|NOW OF COURSE
1154_ben_goertzel|OR OR VARIOUS OTHER OPEN SOURCE A A GI ORIENTED
1154_grant_sanderson|AND NOW LET ME LEAVE YOU SOME WORDS FROM RICHARD FIMANN
1154_richard_karp|A THRU LA
1155_ben_goertzel|PROJECT SO WOULD YOU SAY THERES LIKE MASTERS AND PG THESISES IN THERE PLENTY YOU HAVE PLENTY OOF COURSE I'M IN THE
1155_grant_sanderson|ANHAV SOMETIMES TAKEN A VIEW WHICH I DON'T AGREE WITH VERY WELL
1155_richard_karp|CONVOLUTIONAL NORAL NETWORKS
1156_ben_goertzel|CHALLENGES TO FIND THE A SUPERVISOR WHO WANTS TO FOSTER THAT AT THSORT OF RESEARCH BUT IT'S WAY EASIER THAN IT WAS WHEN I GOT MY PAGE TE ASSURANT
1156_richard_karp|SEEMED TO PERFORM HEM
1156_russ_tedrake|RIGHT BUT IT'S JUST EVEN WITH ONE SORT OF
1157_ben_goertzel|SYSTEM AND THEN THERE IS THE
1157_manolis_kellis|FOR EVERY ONE OF YOUR TASKS
1157_russ_tedrake|NOW IF I'M A DEXTEROUS HAND
1157_sheldon_solomon|THOSE CONCERNS
1158_grant_sanderson|AND I THINK HE'S KIND OF NUTTY
1159_grant_sanderson|FIRST OF ALL THE BEAUTY THAT HE SEES IS AVAILABLE TO OTHER PEOPLE AND TO ME TOO
1159_russ_tedrake|IF I HAVE TO ENUMERATE EVERY POSSIBLE ORDER THAT MY HAND
1159_sheldon_solomon|BUT IT BE NICES SERVE IN A FOCUST WAY TRIED TO SEE
1160_ben_goertzel|INGULARITY  THA
1160_grant_sanderson|ALTHOUGH I MAY NOT BE QUITE AS REFINED AESTHETICALLY AS HE IS I CAN APPRECIATE THE BEAUTY OF A FLOWER
1160_russ_tedrake|CAME INTO CONTACT WITH THE ITH THE BOTTLE
1162_manolis_kellis|WAS ILLUSTRATING
1162_richard_karp|SO YEA YA THEY MAY SEEM TO WORK ON YOUR TRAINING SET
1162_russ_tedrake|BECAUSE WE MOSTLY TOUCHED THE GROUNDER THAN A SMALL NUMBER OF POINTS FOR INSTANCE AND WE HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO GET DEXTEROUS HANDS THAT WAY
1163_richard_karp|D YOU MAY BE ABLE TOO
1164_ben_goertzel|HE HAD THE IDEA OF A SOCIETY OF MINDS TO KY SHOULD ACHIEVE AN E I NOT BY WRITING ONE ALGAR THAN OR ONE PROGRAMME ON
1164_grant_sanderson|HICH ALSO HAVE A BEAUTY
1164_manolis_kellis|WHICH MIGHT ITSELF BE
1165_ben_goertzel|WESHP WITH A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT A EYES OUT THERE
1165_grant_sanderson|I MEAN ITS NOT JUST BEAUTY AT THIS DIMENSION AT ONCE THAN A METER THERE IS ALSO BEAUTY AT SMALLER DIMENSIONS
1166_ben_goertzel|AND THE DIFFERENT AIES WILL
1166_richard_karp|EM BUT WE DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON WE DON'T KNOW THE
1166_russ_tedrake|ROBOTICMANIPUATION IS PROBLEM IS REALLY HARD
1167_ben_goertzel|NTERRACT WITH EACH OTHER EACH PLAYING THEIR OWN ROLL
1167_sheldon_solomon|PROFOUND IN A
1168_ben_goertzel|AND THEN THE TOTALITY OF THE SOCIETY OF AIS WOULD WOULD BE THE THING THAT DISPLAYED THE HUMAN LEVEL INTELLIGENCE AND
1168_richard_karp|EASY TO CHARACTERIZE
1168_sheldon_solomon|IN A LITTLE TA SORT OF BRIEF DANCE AROND
1169_ben_goertzel|HAD  WHEN HE WAS ALIVE I HADMANY DBATE WITH WOODMARVIN ABOUT
1169_grant_sanderson|AS THIS AESTHETIC SENSE ALSO EXIST IN THE LOWER FORMS
1169_manolis_kellis|BOTH THE QUEST OF
1169_sheldon_solomon|HIS THINKING
1170_ben_goertzel|ABOUT THIS IDEA AND HE
1170_manolis_kellis|ME AS A PERSON THROUGH MY OWN LIFE
1170_russ_tedrake|IN RHOBODIXIS BECAUSE WE DO NOT SIMULATE CONTACT ACCURATELY
1171_ben_goertzel|HE REALLY THOUGHT THE MIND WAS MORE LIKE IS SOCIETY THAN THAN I DO LIKE A I THINK I HINK YOU COULD HAVE A
1172_ben_goertzel|MORE SO THAN THAN A SOCIETY DOES SO I THINK HE' STRETCHED THAT
1172_sheldon_solomon|ESCAPED FROM EVIL
1173_sheldon_solomon|IS WHERE HE APPLIES THE IDEAS IN THE DENIAL OF DEATH
1175_manolis_kellis|PART OPHYSICS
1175_richard_karp|PERHAPS E COULD ARGUE THERE IS
1175_russ_tedrake|DIFFICULT THAT IS CHANGED AN
1176_ben_goertzel|SO IN IN THE NINETIES
1176_manolis_kellis|DOES LIFE TRANSCENT PHYSICS
1176_sheldon_solomon|AS ONE OM
1177_ben_goertzel|WHEN I STARRED MY FIRST
1177_richard_karp|AND THENCE YOU HAVE THE NETWORK YOUCAN
1177_russ_tedrake|LIKE THIS INDETERMINACY
1178_ben_goertzel|WHET I WAS AIMING TO DO THERE
1178_russ_tedrake|UT WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO SIMULATE THEM ACCURATELY
1179_russ_tedrake|WE HAVE INCREDIBLE OPEN SOURCE COMMUNITY IN RUBATICS
1180_russ_tedrake|BUT IT ACTUALLY JUST TAKES A PROFESSIONAL ENGINEERING TEAM
1181_ben_goertzel|AND THE TILING IS RIGHT YEYES YE I EE SO THAT THAT YE THE IDEA WITH THE GLOBAL BRAIN WAS YOU KNOW MAYBE THE A I
1181_sheldon_solomon|IN MEN THEN TO DESPISE
1182_sheldon_solomon|AND I FIND IT A BRILLIANT
1183_manolis_kellis|THERE'S A CERTAIN
1183_richard_karp|SORT OF A
1184_manolis_kellis|PLEASURE THAT COMES FROM
1184_richard_karp|VERY INTRICATE AND I THOUGHT CLEAR THAT
1184_russ_tedrake|ITHERE'S A TEAM OF PEOPLE  I'D CERTAINLY SPEND A LOT OF HOURS ON IT MYSELF BUT WHAT IS DRAKE AND WHAT TAM
1185_manolis_kellis|FEELING USEFUL
1185_richard_karp|BEARE NOT EMERGING FROM THE STRUCTURE OF THE CIRCUIT WAT'S NOT CLEAR TO US HUMANS BUT'S CLEAR TO THE CIRCUIT
1185_sheldon_solomon|BUT IN THE CONTEXT OF A STORY OF SOMEONE WHO FINDS OUT THAT HE IS TERMINALLY ILL
1186_russ_tedrake|ENVIRONMENT
1186_sheldon_solomon|OF SOMEONE WHO FINDS OUT THAT THEYARE TERMINALLY ILL AND WHO REACTS
1187_ben_goertzel|CENTRALIZED NETWORK WHERE THE SOCIETY OF
1187_sheldon_solomon|ORIGINALLY AS OF YOU MIGHT EXPECT ANY ONE OF BECOMES MORE
1188_richard_karp|THE ELEPHANT
1189_manolis_kellis|AT BEDTIME EVERY NIGHT
1190_ben_goertzel|AND FRANCIS AND I HAD DIFFERENT
1190_manolis_kellis|ETHE BASICALLY SAY
1190_richard_karp|ACTS OF CAGNITION WE HAVE NO IDEA HOW WE DO AT RELATION
1191_ben_goertzel|VIEW OF MANY THINGS BUT WE BOTH WE BOTH WANT TO MAKE
1191_manolis_kellis|FOR ALL YOU HAVE GIVEN ME
1191_russ_tedrake|MODELING LANGUAGE
1192_manolis_kellis|AND GIVE ME THE STRENGTH
1192_richard_karp|AT LEAST FOR THE VISUAL SYSTEM THE AUDITORY SYSTEM AND SO ON WE DO
1192_russ_tedrake|A BIT LIKE LAB VIU OR SIMULINC WHERE YOU CAN MAKE BLOCKED DIAGRAMS OUT OF COMPLEX
1192_sheldon_solomon|ARE TERMANATELY ILL
1193_manolis_kellis|GIVE ON TO OTHERS
1193_richard_karp|GET SOME UNDERSTANDING OF THE PRINCIPLES THAT THEY OPERATE UNDER BUT
1193_russ_tedrake|OR IT'S IT'S LIKE ROSS IN THAT SENSE WHERE WE MIGHT HAVE LOTS OF ROSS NODES THAT ARE EACH DOING SOME PART OF YOUR SYSTEM
1194_ben_goertzel|WITH A DECENTRALIZED
1194_manolis_kellis|THAT YOU HAVE GIVEN UNTO ME
1195_ben_goertzel|OR ORGANISED ORGANIZATIONAL MODE NOW THE MAIN DIFFERENCE WAS HE WANTED THE
1195_richard_karp|LET ME ASK NO
1195_russ_tedrake|WE TRY TO WRITE IF YOU WRITE A DRAKE SYSTEM THEN YOU HAVE TO UM
1196_russ_tedrake|IT ASKS YOU TO DESCRIBE A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THE SYSTEM
1196_sheldon_solomon|NO NO YOU
1197_manolis_kellis|AND MAYBE THAT WHAT MAKES US
1197_sheldon_solomon|THAT'S A REALLY USEFUL
1198_richard_karp|IS THAT WE HAVE OUR BEGINNING
1198_sheldon_solomon|INOT EVEN KNOW I THINK I'VE BEEN TOO AFRAID TO EVEN THINK ABOUT THE LIKE I HAVE LIKE LIKE
1199_manolis_kellis|TO MY WIFE AND MY STUDENTS DURING THIS PANDEMIC
1199_richard_karp|HOW TO ET IT
1199_sheldon_solomon|SIT HERE
1200_richard_karp|TRUBUTRY WHICH IS VERY VERY VERY FASCINATING WITH SA
1200_russ_tedrake|BUT YOU CAN ALSO DO CONTROL THE SIGN AGAINST IT
1201_russ_tedrake|AN END AND I
1201_sheldon_solomon|AND COULD NOT GET PAST
1202_manolis_kellis|TO FEEL THAT MY BRAINS BEING USED TO INTERACT WITH SMARTEST PEOPLE ON THE PLANET DAY IN DAY OUT
1203_manolis_kellis|AND TO HELP THEM DISCOVER ASPECTS OF THE HUMAN GENUM
1203_russ_tedrake|BUT AM
1203_sheldon_solomon|YE AUND LIT I TOOK A JAMES JOYCE COURSE IN COLLEGE SO I VA A E IEVEN NA
1204_ben_goertzel|IS THE GENERAL INTELLIGENCE
1204_sheldon_solomon|I GUESS READ PARTS OF FENDING HIS WAKE NO WAY
1205_sheldon_solomon|SE IS A FINE BU
1206_ben_goertzel|USY INSTENTIATIONS OF THE SAME KIND OF
1206_russ_tedrake|IT'S HARD TO THINK CLEARLY
1206_sheldon_solomon|WHAT WHULD YOU ARE
1207_ben_goertzel|OUKNOW WE SORTERS KNEW IT WE KNEW ABOUT DISTRIBUTED SYSTEMS WE KNEW ABOUT INCRIPTION SOMETHING WE HADN'T WE
1207_manolis_kellis|THAT HAS NEVER BEEN OBSERVED
1207_richard_karp|OUR DOING IT ON SOMEBODY'S GERM LINE WHICH MEANS THAT ALL OF THEIR DESCENDANTS WILL BE EFFECTED
1207_russ_tedrake|ABOUT A BAG OF DISPERATE PARTS MISTER POTATEHEAD AND A SOFFWARE STACK AND A
1209_ben_goertzel|BUT I LY WE DIDN'T PUT IT TOGETHER IN THE WAY THAT'S BEEN DONE NOW SO WHEN WHEN FATALLIC BEWTER AND IN COLLEAGUES CAME OUT WITH E THEORY UM BLOCK CHAIN
1209_richard_karp|AND EVEN DOING IT ON INDIVIDUALS
1210_ben_goertzel|OMANY MNY YEAR ARS THERE LIKTWENTY  HIRTEENOR SOMETHING
1210_richard_karp|IS SIR
1211_ben_goertzel|THEN THAT WAS LIKE WALL THIS IS INTERESTING LIKE THIS IS
1212_ben_goertzel|SALA ESCRIPTING LANGUAGE IT'S CONNEDORKY IN A WAY AND I DON'T
1213_ben_goertzel|SEE WHY YOU NEED A TURN COMPLETE LANGUAGE FOR THIS PURPOSE BUT ON THE OTHER HAND
1213_richard_karp|SO WE HAVE THIS AN
1213_russ_tedrake|THAT SIMULATES PHYSICS
1213_sheldon_solomon|OULD YOU GIVE TO A YOUNG PERSON TO DAY ABOUT THEIR CAREER ABOUT LIFE
1214_manolis_kellis|ABOUT MY VIEW OF THE WORLD
1214_richard_karp|WONDERFUL AH
1214_sheldon_solomon|MIGHT MY BEG PIECE OF ADVICE THESE DAYS
1215_russ_tedrake|FUNDAMENTAL IMPROVEMENTS ON THE WAY YOU SIMULATE CONTACT
1215_sheldon_solomon|IS YOU KNOW AGAIN IT'S AT THE RISKEST SOUNDING
1216_ben_goertzel|SO THEN I CAME UP WITH THE IDEA THAT TURNED INTO SINGULARITY AT OCALETZ LET'S MAKE IT
1216_manolis_kellis|UNDERSTANDING THAT THEY HAVE OF NOT JUST THE NATURAL WORLD AROUND THEM BUT OF ME TOO
1216_richard_karp|GN EDITIN
1217_ben_goertzel|E CENTRALIZED AGENT SYSTEM
1217_russ_tedrake|SIMILY CONTACT
1217_sheldon_solomon|BUT IT'S TO EMPHASIZE
1218_ben_goertzel|WHERE MONTA DIFFERENT A EYES
1218_manolis_kellis|THAT YOU GET FROM YOUR OWN CHILDREN
1219_ben_goertzel|KNOW WRAPPED UP IN SAY DIFFERENT DOCTOR CONTAINERS OR ALEC SEA CONTAINERS DIFFERENT AIS
1219_manolis_kellis|KNOWS NO BOUANDE
1219_richard_karp|MEDICINE IN VARIOUS WAYS
1219_sheldon_solomon|BUT IT DOESN'T FOLLOW FROM THAT THAT IT'S INTRINSIC THAT IT'S MEANINGLESS
1220_sheldon_solomon|YOU KNOW WHAT THE EXESTENTIAL POINT IS NOT THAT LIFE IS
1221_richard_karp|WHAT ARE TO YOU THE MOST INTERESTING PLACES WERE ALGRYDMS
1221_russ_tedrake|PICKING UP A PLATE
1223_ben_goertzel|BUT IN ETHERIUM IT'S JUST TOO SLOW YOU  NYOU YOU CAN'T YOU CATCH THE I SOMEHOW
1223_manolis_kellis|THAT IMMENSE LOVE AND PASSION
1223_richard_karp|YEA I MEANLY WE CAN CERTAINLY
1224_ben_goertzel|IT'S THE BASIC COMMUNICATION BETWEEN OUR SYSTEMS THAT'S A YEH YES ODISTRIBULATICALLY AND E I
1224_russ_tedrake|HOW DO YOU SIMILY
1224_sheldon_solomon|IT OPENS UP YOU KNOW I THINK IT WAS KURKUGARD WHO SA CONSCIOUSNESS GIVES US THE POSSIBILITY OF POSSIBILITIES
1225_richard_karp|WHICH GENES ARE OPERATIVE IN THE CELL AND UNDER WHAT CONDITIONS AND WHICH PROTANES AFFECT ONE ANOTHER
1225_sheldon_solomon|AND BUT
1226_ben_goertzel|AND IMPORTNOVEL THRE'S A PROXY THAT LIVES IN THAT CONTAINER ALONG WITH THE A I THAT HANDLES THE INTERACTION WITH THE RESTIVE OE OF SINGULARITY NES
1226_manolis_kellis|ITUS THIS BAG OF EMOTIONS
1226_richard_karp|A WHICH PROTON WHICH PROTAINS
1226_russ_tedrake|WE STARTED GETTING MORE PROFESSIONAL ABOUT OUR SOFTWARD DEVELOPMENT DURING THE DARPER RABOTIC CHALLENGE
1227_ben_goertzel|AH IT'S WELL THAT THE IDENTITY OF EACH AGENT
1227_manolis_kellis|THAT TELL ME ABOUT THE RAW MATERIALS THAT MAKE A HUMAN BEING
1228_richard_karp|ECAN SEQUENCE PROTEANS AND MODIFY THEM
1228_russ_tedrake|SOFT WERE ENGINEERING AND HOW THESE HOW TO BRIDLE COMPLEXITY I GUESS THAT'S
1229_ben_goertzel|IN SOME CASES IT SHOULD BE
1229_manolis_kellis|TO BECOME TRULY HUMAN ADULTS
1229_sheldon_solomon|TALKED TO ME SPECIALLY THESE DAYS YE A
1230_manolis_kellis|THERE'S SOMETHING SO BEAUTIFUL ABOUT SEEING THAT PROGRESSION BETWEEN THEM
1230_sheldon_solomon|WE REACT VIGOROUSLY WHEN WE PERCEIVE THAT OUR CHOICES HAVE BEEN CURTAILED
1231_manolis_kellis|THE COMPLEXITY OF THE LANGUAGE
1231_russ_tedrake|SYSTEMS WERE BUILDING FOR RUBBOTS
1231_sheldon_solomon|I'M NOT SURE IF THIS IS HELPFUL ADVICE OR NOT BUT WHAT I SAY TO FOLKS IS THAT
1232_russ_tedrake|AHM
1233_richard_karp|TREATMENT ACCORDING TO
1234_sheldon_solomon|YOU KNOW FOR MOST PEOPLE CHOICE IS A FIRST WORLD PROBLEM
1235_ben_goertzel|SETS OF VEHICLES SOS
1235_manolis_kellis|AS THEIR SOFTWORK IS GETTING IMPLEMENTED ON THAT HARDWORK
1235_richard_karp|ATBE ABLE TO PREDICT WHAT
1235_sheldon_solomon|AND
1236_ben_goertzel|INDIVIDUAL AAR SYSTEMS ON INDIVIDUAL VEHICLES BUT ARE
1236_manolis_kellis|THAT THEIR AFRONTAL COURTICS CONTINUES TO GROW FOR ANOTHER TEN YEARS
1236_sheldon_solomon|THE BEST
1237_richard_karp|TO UNDERSTAND
1237_sheldon_solomon|OPTION IS TO DO SOMETHING
1238_ben_goertzel|NO YOU COULD INVISIONA SITUATION WHERE ALL OF THOSE A AY SYSTEMS ARE PUT ON SINGULARITY
1239_ben_goertzel|MY EAR AND
1239_russ_tedrake|D THERE'S ALSO A TEAM WORKING ON MANIPULATION THERE
1239_sheldon_solomon|DO SOMETHING ELSE WHICH JUST SOUNDS LIKE MY MOM TORTURING ME WHEN I WAS YOUNG BUT YOU KNOW PART OF THE THING THA
1240_manolis_kellis|AND IS SHAPING THESE NORAL CONNECTIONS AS THEYARE FORMING
1240_richard_karp|RECLIVITY FOR
1240_sheldon_solomon|I FIND MYSELF SINGULARLY ILL EQUIPPED
1241_manolis_kellis|SO SEEING THAT TRANSFORMATION
1242_ben_goertzel|IS IS REALLY NICE IF THEY CAN SOMEHOW SHARE THE KNOWLEDGE IN AN OPEN WAY IF THEY CHOOSE TO
1242_richard_karp|AVOID IT
1242_sheldon_solomon|WHERE IT THAT I MAY BE AT THE TALE END OF THE LAST GENERATION OF AMERICANS
1243_manolis_kellis|IS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL THING YOU CAN DO AS A HUMAN BEING
1243_sheldon_solomon|AND
1244_ben_goertzel|SO I THINK THE
1244_manolis_kellis|AN HE COMPLETES YOU HE COMPLETES THAT PATH A JOURNEY
1245_ben_goertzel|THE BENEFIT FROM BEING ON THE
1246_ben_goertzel|ON THE DECENTRALIZED NUTWORK
1247_ben_goertzel|AS WE NVISIONIT
1247_manolis_kellis|AT CREATE HUMAN LIFE
1247_sheldon_solomon|AND SO BUT STILL YOU RECKOMMEND YOUS DU
1248_manolis_kellis|TO ADD THE HUMAN PART
1248_richard_karp|ATTRACT THE INTEREST OF THE MONTLEY COLLECTION OF AITHGRATE STUDENTS THAT HE WAS TEACHING
1248_sheldon_solomon|TO DO SO IN AGAINM THIS IS OBSO BACK TO THE HYDEGER GUI BECAUSE
1249_manolis_kellis|ATICS AND DICADES
1249_russ_tedrake|FOR ANY DISH A IN ANYBODY'S KITCHEN
1249_sheldon_solomon|I MEANT YOU KNOW I CONSIDER MYSELF A PROFESSOR BUT WHAT HAPPENS IF MOST OF THE SCHOOLS GO OUT OF BUSINESS
1250_russ_tedrake|WITH ENOUGH CONFIDENCE THAT IT COULD BE A COMMERCIAL PRODUCT
1251_richard_karp|OBSERVEIT IN AND I THINK HE WAS GOT HIS BEST IN THE CLASS ROOM I THINK HE REALLY CAME TO LIFE
1251_russ_tedrake|AND AND IT HAS DEEP LEARNING PERCEPTION IN THE LOUP IT HAS COMPLEX DYNAMICS IN THE LUPIT HAS CONTROLLER IT HAS A PLANNER
1252_ben_goertzel|SOME OTHER AIS
1252_richard_karp|AND HAD FUN AND NOT ONLY TEACHING BUT A
1253_richard_karp|BU TAM YOU ARE ENGAGING IN CHICHAT WITH THE STUDENTS AND YOU KNOW INGRATIATING HIMSELF WITH THE STUDENTS
1253_russ_tedrake|AND PUT IT THROUGH THI
1253_sheldon_solomon|O FINE YOURSELF
1255_ben_goertzel|IF YOU'RE WILLING TO SIFT TO AN AGENT BASED MODEL OF DEVELOPMENT
1255_sheldon_solomon|ER UT DON'T DONT
1257_ben_goertzel|A NICE WORKING VERSION OF SINGULARLY THAT PLATFORM

1269_russ_tedrake|MAKE SURE THET WON'T HAPPEN AGAIN
1270_sheldon_solomon|TO BE HONEST
1271_ben_goertzel|PROBLEMS WHICH SHIRE
1271_russ_tedrake|ADD THAT TO OUR DISTRIBUTION AND UNDERSTAND THAT
1272_ben_goertzel|BUT THEY JIS VERY DIFFICULT TO SOLVE AND IN SOME CASES THE INDIVIDUALS WHO STARTED THOSE PROJECTS WERE NOT
1272_richard_karp|A FER
1273_richard_karp|THE
1273_russ_tedrake|THEREIS LIKE REALLY SUBTLE QUESTIONS AT THE CORNER CASES
1274_manolis_kellis|AND A BETTER MENTER
1275_russ_tedrake|YE IN IN WHATEVER THE PROBLEM IS YES I MEAN I THINK WE HAVE TO GET BETTER AT THAT IM A CONTROL THEORY HIS HI
1275_sheldon_solomon|WHEN PEOP WHEN WE MEET PEOPLE
1276_manolis_kellis|FIRST OF ALL NOT YOU LEFTLLY PUT CONNEC
1276_richard_karp|IN PARTICULAR IDEAS AND ALGATOS OF COMPUTER SCIENCE THE EFINED
1276_sheldon_solomon|THAT NO ARE KITS AN NE'ER LI GO
1277_ben_goertzel|BEING PUT ON THE BLOCK CHAIN AS THE IS THE OTHER IMO YOU MY FURTSY WILL BE ON THE BLOCK CHAIN THET'LL JUST BE ON THE BLOCK CHAIN
1277_richard_karp|WERE BIG AHA MOMENTS FOR STUDENTS WHERE THEY
1278_ben_goertzel|IN A WAY THE ENFORCES
1278_richard_karp|FOR SOME REASON WACE THEY GOT IT IT CLICKED FOR THEM AND THEY FELL IN LOVE WITH COMPETER SINS
1279_russ_tedrake|EXPLORATION OR EXPLOITATION BUT BUT IN
1280_ben_goertzel|IT'S ALMOST EVERYWHERE INSIDE EVERYTHING WAT WEREIS THE BOUNDARY BETWEEN A I AND SOPHUERE  AMIN SHE CAN TO REGULATE A AI
1280_richard_karp|SOME OF THEM JUST DON'T DON'T NEED MUCH
1280_sheldon_solomon|TREMENDOUSLY IMPORTANT
1281_ben_goertzel|PART OF WHAT I THINK
1282_ben_goertzel|WERE DOING WITH THINGS LIKE SINGULARITY THAT PROLECOL
1283_richard_karp|HUMANS ARE COMPLICATED OU
1283_russ_tedrake|PROVIDE THE MAXIMUM INFORMATION TO REDUCE THAT UNCERTAINTY
1284_ben_goertzel|TO COUNTERACT THAT SORT OF THING
1284_russ_tedrake|F YU THERE'S A PERAMETER YOU ON A LEARN ABOUT WHAT IS THE APTIMOL
1284_sheldon_solomon|AGAIN AS CORNY AS IT SOUNDS AN
1285_richard_karp|IF YOU COULD RELIVE A MOMENT IN YOUR LIFE OUTSIDE A FAMILY BECAUSE IT MADE YOU TRULY HAPPY
1285_russ_tedrake|RJECTORY I COULD EXECUTE TO LEARN ABOUT THAT PERAMETER FOR INSTANCE

1289_russ_tedrake|YOU CAN SPENDLE A LOT OF TIME
1289_sheldon_solomon|SO I MEAN ON ON THE POINT OF THE SOUL
1290_ben_goertzel|TRYING TO TAMP DOWN
1290_russ_tedrake|ARY YOU CAN WRITE GOOD ALGRYDOMS THAT TRY TO SPEND MOST OF THEIR TIME
1291_sheldon_solomon|ON A PERSONAL LEVELLED YOU HAVE
1292_russ_tedrake|IMAGINE YOUR YOUR BUILDING A
1292_sheldon_solomon|A AN ANSWER TO THE MEANING OF YOUR LIFE OF SOMETHING THAT BROUGHT YOU
1293_sheldon_solomon|OUR MEANING A
1294_ben_goertzel|IT'S NOT PERFECT BUT BUT IT IT IT OPERATES AND

1296_sheldon_solomon|SENSE HERER
1297_ben_goertzel|RUN AN ALGAREND
1297_russ_tedrake|SPACE OF POSSIBLE PLACES WHERE THAT CAN BE
1298_ben_goertzel|MY GOOD FRIEND TUFI SALIBA HAS
1298_russ_tedrake|THOSE ARE THE MOST SORT OF PROFOUND QUESTIONS WE ASK OF OUR WORLD LIKE
1298_sheldon_solomon|A BET YO IM
1299_russ_tedrake|AH WHAT'S THE AH WHAT'S THE WORST THAT CAN HAPPEN AH
1300_sheldon_solomon|NOT READY TO
1301_ben_goertzel|THERE THERE'S A LOT OF
1302_richard_karp|BUT ALSO CONSIDERING THE PURCHASE
1302_sheldon_solomon|JUST REALLY WITH A A
1304_ben_goertzel|THAT SHARE THE SAME KNOWLEDGE STORE IN IN REAL TIME IN INRAM RI SINGULARITY THAT ALLOWS
1304_richard_karp|POK CAST IS WERTH SUPPORTING  THE FUTURE
1304_russ_tedrake|E GAN HAVE FLEETS OF ROBOTS THICK AND
1304_sheldon_solomon|AND IS THERE MEMORIES THAT STAND OUT TO YOU FROM CHILDHOOD FROM EARLIER THAT LIKE
1307_ben_goertzel|HE KNOWLEDGEGRAPHINS INSIDE INSIDE THE THE OPEN COG SYSTEM
1307_russ_tedrake|ENOUGH DAT OF THE
1307_sheldon_solomon|MAINLY A STUFF HAPPIER THAT I MEAN YOU KNOW MY FAMILY AR
1308_sheldon_solomon|ALSO A CHANK
1311_sheldon_solomon|I CONSIDER
1312_ben_goertzel|HE COULD SE THAT IN THE HUMAN BODY LIKE THE BRAIN HAS
1313_sheldon_solomon|VERY FORTUNATE TOO
1314_ben_goertzel|WHICH TIGHTLY INTERCONNECT LIKE CORNICAL COLUMNS WITH IT WITHIN THE QARTEX FOR EXAMPLE
1314_sheldon_solomon|BEEN A SO CALLED PRODUCT OF THE AMERICAN DREAM IN ON MY GRANDPARENTS OR WERE
1315_ben_goertzel|WITH THE OTHER ONE ABOUT EOPUL THAT YOU TALK TO SO YOU OFTEN HAVE NUTWORKS WITH I NUTWORKS WITHIN NUTWORKS WITH PROGRESSIVELY
1315_sheldon_solomon|FAYSICKY PEASANTS MY
1316_ben_goertzel|LOOSER COUPLING AS AS AS YOU GET GET HIGHER UP IN THAT
1316_russ_tedrake|THAT'S THEN MAKES THE PROMPSE SO MUCH HARDER A DISH WASHER UNLOADING IS A LITTLE SAFE AS BY HOMROBODICS IS A
1316_sheldon_solomon|HE BE LIKE O YOU WON'T HAVE TO
1317_ben_goertzel|HIERARCHY I MIN YOU HAVE THE ENBIALTYU OF THE ININ THE INTERNATE AS IN AS A
1317_russ_tedrake|IS REALLY EXCITING AND JUST TO CLARIFY I MEAN FOR PEOPLE WHOM I NOT KNOW AN TEAR I TAYORA RESEARCH INSTITUTE SO THER
1318_ben_goertzel|JUST NUTWORKING MEDIUM AND I THINK I THINK THAT'S WHAT WE'REGOING TO HAVE
1319_russ_tedrake|WE ALREADY HAVE RUMBAS
1320_ben_goertzel|WHAT WOULD YOU RECOMMEND I GE ALL O THAT SO THAT'S MUCH EASIER I'M AN OOPEN COG
1321_ben_goertzel|ISCELA RESEARCH SYSTEM
1321_russ_tedrake|IT'S ONLY A MATTER OF TIME TILL THEY SPRING ARMS AND START DOING SOMETHING U USEFUL LIKE THAT EM SO
1322_ben_goertzel|SO IT TAKES SOME EXPERTEES AND SOMETIME WE HAVE TWO TOILS BUT IT'S
1322_sheldon_solomon|AND THE
1323_russ_tedrake|IT LOTS OF PEOPLE HAVE LOTS OF MOTIVATIONS
1324_ben_goertzel|AN I MEAN WHAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS WE HOPE TO CHANGE WITH THE TURATI EYE
1324_russ_tedrake|IT'S BEEN SUPPERINTERESTING ACTUALLY LEARNING ABOUT
1324_sheldon_solomon|PROUD OF
1325_ben_goertzel|OPEN COCK TO POINO VERSIONIS JUST MAKE
1325_sheldon_solomon|WAS IS FUNNY
1326_ben_goertzel|ON THE OTHER HAND SINGULARITINA
1327_sheldon_solomon|MATAU
1328_ben_goertzel|A LITTLE MORE WITH USEABILITY AND MIND ALL THE BLOT CHAINES IS STILL KIND OF A PAIN SOMIN I MEAN I YOUR A
1328_russ_tedrake|ANDA
1328_sheldon_solomon|HE'VE ALSO CONTRIBUTED SOME REALLY IMPORTANT IDEAS
1329_ben_goertzel|COMMANDLINGUY
1331_ben_goertzel|OPEN DICENTRALIZED PULOCOS
1331_sheldon_solomon|AL WU THINK ABOUT
1332_russ_tedrake|AS IT THIS A DIVISION HA INTERESTING THERE THAT YOU CAN DO SO MUCH GOOD WITH A ROBAT W
1332_sheldon_solomon|LEAST  AT LEAST FOR ME AND I'M SURE THEREIS
1333_sheldon_solomon|CONACT
1334_sheldon_solomon|THESE DESPERATE
1335_russ_tedrake|'S A GAP TO FILL
1336_russ_tedrake|OF UNDERSTANDING I MUS EXCECTLY KIND OF BEAUTIFUL I
1337_ben_goertzel|U CITIZENS CANT BUT BY BY U S LAW SO RIGHT NOW THAT'S KIND OF A MINOR POINT
1339_ben_goertzel|IT ALSO IS THE CASE THA
1339_sheldon_solomon|AND THAT IN TURN
1340_russ_tedrake|I DO FEEL LIKE
1341_ben_goertzel|BEING PUT INTO PLACE AND YOU COULD SEE THAT IN THE MUSIC INDUSTRY RITE I'M IN NAPSTER JUST HAPPENED AND BIT TORRENT JUST HAPPENED
1344_russ_tedrake|LIKE RIGER BODIES
1346_ben_goertzel|SORT OF WORK WITH IT WITH THE DISENTRALIZED REALITY
1346_sheldon_solomon|REVIEW  FIR STA SNAP A BLOT CAST
1347_ben_goertzel|YOU ARE THE CHIEF SCIENTIST OF HANDSOME ROBADICS
1348_russ_tedrake|REALLY DISLIKE THE FACT THAT ROBOTS ARE AFRAID OF TOUCHING THE WORLD ALL OVER THEI BODY
1348_sheldon_solomon|NOW LET ME LEAVE YOU WITH SOME WORDS FROM FODIMA ANABOCA
1349_sheldon_solomon|AS SHELDAN USES IN HIS BOOK
1350_russ_tedrake|ARE ALMOST ALWAYS SOFT THEY HAVE SOME SORT
1351_ben_goertzel|SO FAR HE REMAINS MORE INTERESTING  THAN THAN HIS CREATION ALTHOGHALTHOUGH
1352_russ_tedrake|AM BUT IFYOU LOOK UP AND DOWN THE ARM WE'RE JUST
1353_ben_goertzel|AND I COULD SEE WE
1355_ben_goertzel|A THE ASSION IR
1355_russ_tedrake|A ISOF ISA
1356_russ_tedrake|IT HAS SOME OF THE PROBLEMS THAT WE TALKED ABOUT IN TERMS OF SIMULATION
1357_ben_goertzel|AND WE WERE BOTH UGE FANS OF THE WORK OF VA PHILIP CEDIC THE DESIGNS FICTION WRITER
1358_ben_goertzel|AND I WANT TO CREATE
1358_russ_tedrake|A YOU YOU TURN
1362_ben_goertzel|DAVID HE WANTED EXACTLY THE SAME THING BUT HE HAD A DIFFEREN
1363_ben_goertzel|IDEA  F HOW TO DO IT HEWANTED TO GET
1364_ben_goertzel|COMPUTATIONAL COMPASSION LIKEHE WANTED TO GET MACHINES THAT
1366_russ_tedrake|ITIT CHANGES THE COMPUTATIONAL PROBLEM
1367_ben_goertzel|WHAT IS THE ABSTRACT COGNITIVE
1367_russ_tedrake|BECAUSE OF THE I THINK ARE
1368_russ_tedrake|WORLD IN OUR MATHEMATICS HAS BY USED US TOWARDS RIGID
1369_ben_goertzel|LOOK YOU IN THE FACE IN THE EYE AND LOVE YOU HANDSOME SO I
1370_russ_tedrake|THINK THA THE THE FUTURE IS UNWRITTEN THERE EH
1372_ben_goertzel|THEN I MOVED TO HANCANG
1372_russ_tedrake|IF WE EMBRACE THE SOFTNESS OF THE WORLD IT MAKES EM
1373_russ_tedrake|MAKES THINGS SMOOTHER RIGHT SO THAT DE THE
1374_ben_goertzel|NO IVE BEEN LIVING
1375_russ_tedrake|CONTINUOUS BUT IT ALSO MEANS POTENTIALLY LESS ERO INSTANTANEOUSLY
1376_russ_tedrake|AD FOR INSTANCE I WON'T ECESSARILY
1379_russ_tedrake|MEASURING THE DEFORMATION
1380_ben_goertzel|COMPLEX CONSUME OUR ELECTRONICS THAT LARGE SCILL IN LO COSS IS JUST IT'S ASTOUNDING THE HARDORECO SYSTEM THE YU AVIN
1380_russ_tedrake|UM SO THERE'S A TEAM AT AT AT TIARI THAT'S WORKING ON SOFT HANDS
1383_ben_goertzel|I INVITED HIM TO HONG KON TO GIVE A TALK AT HONG KONG POLLYYU
1383_russ_tedrake|AND REALLY IF YOU DON'T HAVE TACTAL INFORMATION THEN YOU'RE YOU'RE BLIND IN AN IMPORTANT WAY
1384_ben_goertzel|AND I INTRODUCED HEM
1384_russ_tedrake|SO IT HAPPENS THAT SOFT RABOTICS AND TACTAL SENSING TEND TO GO HAND IN HAND
1386_ben_goertzel|SO THROUGH THE
1386_russ_tedrake|BELIEVE THAT WAS THE NAME OF IT ACTUALLY HISTOR AH
1387_ben_goertzel|VESTORS I CONNECTE HIM TO
1387_russ_tedrake|RIGHT THE YOU TWO REALLY GREAT ARE RECOMMENDED HIGHLY
1388_ben_goertzel|HE MANAGED TO GET SOME FUNDING
1388_russ_tedrake|LOOK ON YOU TUBE FOR THE TWENTY TWENTY VERSIONS
1389_ben_goertzel|BASELY PORT HANSON RABALICS TO HON CAN
1390_russ_tedrake|AM
1391_russ_tedrake|NO IIE POURED MY HEART INTO THAT CLASS A
1394_ben_goertzel|AS WE WERE BOTH THERE IN THE SAME PLACE
1395_russ_tedrake|IT'S IT'S A STRANGE NAME BUTT TAM
1396_ben_goertzel|TO MAKE HIS ROBOTS
1396_russ_tedrake|I THOUGHT IT CAPTURED THE
1397_ben_goertzel|SMARTER THAT N TEN THEY WERE
1397_russ_tedrake|CONTROL WAS GOOD AT DOING AND WHAT CONTROL WAS BAD AT DOING SO WHAT DO I MEAN BY UNDERACTUATED
1399_russ_tedrake|AH HAS MANY DEGREES OF FREEDOM FOR INSTANCE
1402_ben_goertzel|SOPHIA AND THE OTHER OTHER THER SO HEAVY I WOULD BE JUST ONE OF THE ROBOTS IN THE SA IN ISIGAGNA
1403_russ_tedrake|IVE DEGREES OF FREEDOM
1405_russ_tedrake|IF YOU TAKE AWAY ONE OF THOSE MOTORS
1406_ben_goertzel|DAVID AND I TALKED ABOUT THAT FOR QUITE A WHILE
1407_ben_goertzel|BEORE COFOUNDING
1408_russ_tedrake|MORE MUSCLES THAN
1409_ben_goertzel|WAS ALWAYS THAT SOPHIA
1410_russ_tedrake|BUT STILL THERE IS AN REALLY IMPORTANT DEGREE OF FREEDOM BAT I HAVE WHICH IS THE LOCATION OF MY CENTRE OF MASS
1411_russ_tedrake|IN SPACE FOR INSTANCE
1412_ben_goertzel|THAN ANY ONE CAN USE TO EXPERIMENT WITH EIR DIFFERENT A IOGYRISMS
1412_russ_tedrake|RIGHT I CAN JUMP INTO THE AIR
1413_ben_goertzel|PLATFORM AN SINGULARITY NET OF COURSE FITS RIGHT INTO THAT RIT CAT SINGULARLY NET IT'S AN A P I MARKET PLACE SO ANY ONE COUL PUT THE E A ON THERE
1414_ben_goertzel|OPEN COG
1415_russ_tedrake|THE PASSIVE DANEMIC WALKERS
1416_russ_tedrake|ARE THE EXTREME VIEW OF THAT WHERE YOU TAKEN AWAY ALL THE MOTORS AND YOU HAVE TO LET PHYSICS DO THE WORK
1418_ben_goertzel|YE HE'S INTERESTED IN
1419_russ_tedrake|THAT'S REFERRING TO WALKING IF YOU'RE LIKE FALLING FORWARD
1421_russ_tedrake|IT'S A SUBTLE POINT WHEN YOU'RE WHEN YOU'RE IN
1424_ben_goertzel|WHOLE LOT OF DIFFERENT PEOPLE IN AN EMOTIONALLY COMPELLING WAY AND
1426_russ_tedrake|WITH BASICALLY THINKING OF THE SYSTEM IS FULLY ACTUATED UNLESS YOU SUDDENLY NEEDED TO ACCELERATE DOWN SUPERFAST
1429_russ_tedrake|AEROPLANES OR OTHER THINGS I THINK YOU HAVE TO EMBRACE THE UNDERACTUATED DYNAMICS
1430_ben_goertzel|EEMED TO MME THAT
1430_russ_tedrake|MANIPULATION
1432_ben_goertzel|THE BEST WAY
1434_ben_goertzel|WOULD BE TWO
1435_ben_goertzel|INFUSE THEM WITH LOVE AND COMPASSION THE WIT THE WAY THAT WE DO OUR OWN CHILDREN SO YOU WANT TO
1437_russ_tedrake|AM BUT ACTUALLY THOSE ORE THE PROBLEMS THAT MAKE ME SO EXCITED ABOUT MANIPULATION RIGHT NOW IS THAT IT BREAKS SOME OF THE
1439_russ_tedrake|WHAT ARE SOME INTERESTING INSIGHTS YOU COUL SAY ABOUT TRYING TO SOLVE AND UNDER ACTUATED
1441_ben_goertzel|INTUITIVE SENSE OFTIS WHICH IT CAN THEN
1443_ben_goertzel|SO FEAR WHICH MEANS
1443_russ_tedrake|HAS BEEN OPTIMIZATION
1444_ben_goertzel|WHICH MEANS WISDOM
1445_ben_goertzel|SOME IT SEEMED TO ME
1445_russ_tedrake|AND YOU USE THE LANGUAGE OF OPTIMAL CONTROL
1447_russ_tedrake|IN ORDER TO MAKE THOSE DECISIONS AND BALANCE UM  ARE THESE COMPLICATED EQUATIONS
1450_ben_goertzel|LEARNED FROM PEOPLE
1451_ben_goertzel|ND NOT JUST LEARN FACTUUL KNOWLEDGE BUT LEARN HUMAN HUMAN VALUES AND ETHICS FROM PEOPLE WHILE BEING THEIR
1452_russ_tedrake|IN UNDER ACTURATE SYSTEMS WHEN YOU SAY LET PHYSICALLY SOM THE WORK
1453_ben_goertzel|THAT WAS THE GRAND VISION NO IF YOU'VE EVER WORKED WITH ROBOTS
1453_russ_tedrake|SO THERE'S A KIND OF FEED BU FEE BACK
1454_russ_tedrake|LOOP THAT OBSERVES THE STATE
1456_russ_tedrake|LIKE YOU
1457_russ_tedrake|RIGHT RIGHT AROUND THE TIME OF THE DARPA CHALLENGE
1458_russ_tedrake|WE HAD A COMPLICATED PERCEPTION SYSTEM IN THE DARPER CHALLENGE
1459_ben_goertzel|MANY OF MY
1459_russ_tedrake|AND A SMALL ENBOR COMPUTE
1460_russ_tedrake|SINCE THEN WE HAVE NOW THA SO THE DEEP LEARNING REVOLUTION UNQUESTIONABLY CHANGED
1461_russ_tedrake|WITH PERCEPTION FOR RHOBOTICS AND CONTROL
1463_ben_goertzel|IT YOU HAVE A DIALOGUE SYSTEM
1463_russ_tedrake|WE GET INTO NOT ONLY I THINK THIS THE FIRST USE OF IT NATURALLY WOULD BE THE
1465_ben_goertzel|NO SPECI TEXTALGAR IN THEM
1466_russ_tedrake|IMAGINE I'VE  VERY NOISY EMING OR IT'S A
1467_ben_goertzel|RE'S SOMETHING THAT RE'S SOMETHING THAT REMEMBERS THAT SOMETHING THAT LEARNS
1468_russ_tedrake|IS ESTIMATE THE FULL STATE OF MY SHIRT INCLUDING LIKE WHAT'S HAPPENING N THE BACK YOEVER WER A RAN
1469_russ_tedrake|THAT'S JUST NOT THE RIGHT
1470_russ_tedrake|EH SPECIFICATION
1472_ben_goertzel|IT A NIXOF LIKE
1473_ben_goertzel|HANDCOATED RULES
1473_russ_tedrake|SO YOU REALLY NEED IT'S IT BEGS NEW QUESTIONS ABOUT STATE REPRESENTATION
1475_russ_tedrake|JUST THE IDEA OF CHOPPING ONIONS
1476_ben_goertzel|TRAINING DADA HAVE WHAT SOPHIA SAYS IN A WIDE VARITY OF CONVERSATIONS BUT WE CAN SEE
1476_russ_tedrake|OR CARROTS TURNED OUT TO BE BETTER
1480_ben_goertzel|ON THE OTHER HAND IT RAMBLES LIKE MAD THE SOPHIA CHAP BY
1480_russ_tedrake|SHY I MOVING AROUND A PARTICULAR OBJECT RIGHT THEN I THINK ABOUT IT'S GOT A POSITION AN ORIENTATION IN SPACE THAT'S THE DESCRIPTION I WANT NOW
1481_russ_tedrake|WHEN I'M CHAPPING AN ONION OCE THAT THE FIRST CHAP COMES DOWN I HAVE NOW A HUNDRED PIECES OF ONION
1482_russ_tedrake|DOES MY CONTROL SYSTEM REALLY NEED TO UNDERSTAND THE POSITION AND ORIENTATION AND EVEN THE SHAPE OF THE HUNDRED PIECES OF ONION IN ORDER TO MAKE A DECISION
1483_ben_goertzel|LONGER PERIOD RIGTS SO THERE NO YOU CAN PROBABLY SURMOUNT THAT USING REFORMER AND LUCKY USING VARIOUS OTHER DEEP NURLE
1484_ben_goertzel|ARCHITECTURES TO IMPROVE THE WAY THESE TRANSOR MODALS ARE TRAINED BUT
1484_russ_tedrake|IT'S NOT RIGHT AS SO
1486_russ_tedrake|THE STATE THAT IS GIVEN TO US BY LAGRANGIAN MECHANICS THERE IS A AN
1488_ben_goertzel|EMTED A CIA
1490_ben_goertzel|ANY DAMNED THING IN THE WORLD
1492_russ_tedrake|THE ALGRENUMS BEING
1493_ben_goertzel|ABOUT THINGS WHERE THERE'S NO NONLENGUISTIC GROUNDING
1493_russ_tedrake|LIK CONTROL OPTIMAL SO FOR INSTANCE IF THE CONTACT MECHANICS
1494_ben_goertzel|WHAT YOU CAN DO FOR SOFIA
1494_russ_tedrake|OF ALL OF THOSE ONION PIECES
1498_ben_goertzel|ART CREATION
1499_russ_tedrake|OR AS A SAW OVER REACH
1501_ben_goertzel|WHAT'S YOUR WHAT'S YOUR SENSE OF THAT KIND OF ANNOYANCE THAT THE ACOMMUTY HAS IITHINK
1502_russ_tedrake|YOU KNOW IT REARS ITS HEAD I MEAN IN LINEYAR SYSTEMS IT'S NOT A PROBLEM WE JUST WE JUST
1503_russ_tedrake|A BOTTLE KNIKE AND WHAT WE KNOW HOW TO DO WITH CONTROL
1504_russ_tedrake|IT HAPPENS TO BE A BOTTLE NECK
1506_ben_goertzel|UT THEIR ICKENPEOPLE
1510_ben_goertzel|EVEN IF I WENT DIRECTLY INVOLVED WITH IT ONCE I DUG A LITTLE DEEPER
1513_ben_goertzel|OLKS LIKE YON THE KIN
1513_russ_tedrake|THAT DON'T ACTUALLY REQUIRE YOU TO THINK THAT MUCH ABOUT ON DIRECT OR DYNAMICS AT ALL EVEN
1514_ben_goertzel|HAVE REMAINED PISTOFF AFTER THE AFTER THEIR AFTER THEIR INITIAL WHILE HE INTERIN THIS SAI TING THAT'S THE THING ALIE I
1514_russ_tedrake|BUT CERTAINLY UNDERACTUATED DYNAMIX ONCE I HAVE IF I IF I REACH OUT AND GRAB SOMETHING
1516_ben_goertzel|IRONIC BECAUSE H ON THE CUNE
1517_ben_goertzel|FACE BOOK WHICH IS USING MACHINE LEARNING TO
1517_russ_tedrake|SO THEYEBUILT WE'VE BUILT SYSTEMS THE KIND OF
1518_ben_goertzel|PROGRAMME THE BRAINS OF THE PEOPLE IN THE WORLD TOWARD VAPID
1518_russ_tedrake|AN REDUCE THE NEED FOR THAT
1519_russ_tedrake|ENVELOPING GRASPS AND THE LIKE
1520_russ_tedrake|EM BUT I THINK THE REALLY GOOD PROBLEMS OFE MANAPULATION SO I
1521_ben_goertzel|IN SUCH A BLATENTLY DESTRUCTIVE WAY
1522_ben_goertzel|WHY WOULD YOUR ETHICS NOT ALLOW YOU TO USE MACHINE LEARNING TO MAKE A LOVABLE
1522_russ_tedrake|PICK AND PLACE
1523_russ_tedrake|THAT'S LIKE A LOT OF PEOPLE THINK OF THAT JUST GRASPING
1524_ben_goertzel|OOLISH PEOPLE INTO ITS THEATRICAL
1526_ben_goertzel|AND DOESN'T BOTHER TO GO OUT THERE
1527_ben_goertzel|DAVID HANSON
1529_ben_goertzel|AND I HAVE NOT AGREED WITH EVERYTHING
1531_ben_goertzel|DAVID ALSO WAS NOT AGREE WITH EVERYTHING DAVID HAD SAID ET ONAAAOUT E AFORU POINT I MEAN DAIN DAVID
1531_russ_tedrake|I KNOW WE COULD HAND DESIGN TO CONTROL HER THAT WOULD DO IT
1534_ben_goertzel|THERE HAVE BEEN CONVERSATIONS
1534_russ_tedrake|HURE IN OUR APPROACH
1535_ben_goertzel|WITHIN HANSON ROBATICS AND BETWEEN ME AND DAVID WHERE I WAS LIKE LETS
1535_russ_tedrake|HAN THE CHALLENGE OF TYING ANYBODY'S SHOES
1536_russ_tedrake|S A GREAT CHALLENGE
1540_ben_goertzel|SOFIL WAS WORKING AND
1540_russ_tedrake|MY TOUCH AND SMELL HE SAYS BUT AH
1542_ben_goertzel|OPOSTD TO THIS AND YO HE WAS ACTUALLY QUITE RIGHT ABOUT IT WHAT HE SAID WAS YOU CAN TELL PEOPLE EXACTLY HOW IT'S WORKING
1543_russ_tedrake|I THINK IT'S SUPERIMPORTANT LET'S EVEN JUST IN A PRACTICAL SENSE IF WE FORGET ABOUT THE EMOTIONAL PART OF IT
1544_russ_tedrake|AH
1547_ben_goertzel|DE FOND WHO WAS
1547_russ_tedrake|AND WE HAVE SOME FOLKS THAT AT TOYRA THAT ARE TRYING TO TOY RESEARCHS THAT ARE TRYING TO BUILD BAMAX ROUGHLY AND A
1548_ben_goertzel|CONTROLLING THAT THAT THE THE PHILIPCEDIC
1550_russ_tedrake|IF THE ROBAT AT WAS WALKING AROUND MY HOME LOOKED MORE LIKE A TEDDY BEAR
1551_ben_goertzel|FIL THEY WERE TALKING TO A SMALL PART OF ME BELIEVES THAT THEY WERE RIGHT ACTUALLY
1552_ben_goertzel|BECAUSE OUR UNDERSTAND WEL WE DON'T UNDERSTAND THE UNIVERSE TAT IT TE MEING THERE IS A COSMIC MIND FIELD THAT WE'RE ALL EMBETDED IN
1553_ben_goertzel|I MEAN WERGOIN I HAVE TO DEAL WITH THIS KIND OF I IGELLATLY AND AABOUT SOPHIA I WOULD SAY
1554_russ_tedrake|RIGHT YOU COULD
1555_ben_goertzel|HOUSE SO FIEL WORK SAND I'VE POSTED ON LINE
1556_russ_tedrake|INSTEAD OF PEOPLE JUDGING IT AND LOOKING AT IT AS IF A THAT'S NOT DOING AS WELL AS A HUMAN
1557_ben_goertzel|WEBSENOT MEN I POSTED A MODERATELY DETAILED ARTICLE EXPLAINING LIKE
1557_russ_tedrake|HEY ARE GOING TO TRY TO HELP OUT THE CUTE TETTY BEART RIN
1558_ben_goertzel|NOTE THE FUNNY THING IS
1559_russ_tedrake|I THINK WE'RE BUILDING ROBOTS WRONG
1561_ben_goertzel|ND THEN THEY TALKED TO HER
1562_ben_goertzel|I NEVER BE MORE AGENCY AND
1562_russ_tedrake|A IT IS A MAGICAL MOMENT BUT THEREIS NO TOUCHING I I GUESS THE QUESTION I AVE HAVE EVER BEEN NONE
1563_ben_goertzel|CONSCIOUSNESS DETTER THAN THAN HIS
1563_russ_tedrake|HAVE YOU HAD A HUMAN ROBOT EXPERIENCE WERE A
1564_russ_tedrake|I A ROBART TOUCHED YOU
1565_russ_tedrake|AND LIK GOS LIKE WAY
1566_ben_goertzel|ETHICALISTU THERE
1567_ben_goertzel|ONE ISSUE WITH
1568_russ_tedrake|I MAY I THINK WHEN YOUARE
1569_russ_tedrake|IN ON THE DETAILS THEN
1571_ben_goertzel|HERE'S ARTICLES ON LINE THAT THERE'S
1573_ben_goertzel|THE WAY SO FEL WORKS
1573_russ_tedrake|MACHINE THAT NEED IS TO BE RESPECTED AN
1574_russ_tedrake|IF WE BUILD OUR ROBOTS CORRECTLY I THINK THEN THOSE A LOT OF THOSE CONCERNS COULD GO AWAY
1575_ben_goertzel|THE OTHER IS
1576_russ_tedrake|AND
1577_russ_tedrake|I MEAN I DO THINK TOUCH IS SO FUN A MANT I TET ADELSON IS A IS GREAT HES OF PERCEPTIABLE SCIENTIST AT AMIT
1578_ben_goertzel|KILLING THEM WHEN THEY
1578_russ_tedrake|AND HE STUDIED VISION MOST OF HIS LIFE AND HE SAID
1580_ben_goertzel|YOU KNOW THE WHOLE MEDIATE INDUSTRY IS BASED ON FOOLING PEOPLE THE WAY THEY WANT TO BE FOOLED AND WI WE ARE FOOLING PEOPLE
1582_ben_goertzel|WE ARE PLAYING ON PEOPLE'S SENSE OF AMPATHY AND COMPASSION
1582_russ_tedrake|ES SOMETHING VERY A IMPORTANT
1583_ben_goertzel|SO THAT WE CAN GIVE THEM A GOOD USE OR EXPERIENCE WITH HELPFUL ROBOTS NEA AND SO THAT WE CAN
1584_russ_tedrake|PASSIVELY PERCEIVE THE WORLD
1585_russ_tedrake|BUT IT'S FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT IF YOU CAN DO AN EXPERIMENT RH AND IF YOU CAN CHANGE THE WORLD
1587_russ_tedrake|AND A PASSIVE OBSERVER
1588_russ_tedrake|YOU CAN IN DIALOGUE O YOU I WAS YOUR INITIAL EXAMPLE YOU COULD HAVE AN
1589_ben_goertzel|TO SCAM PEOPLE OUT OF THEIR MONEY W THEN YOU'RE USING THE
1589_russ_tedrake|ACTIVE EXPERIMENT EXCHANGED BUT I THINK IF YOU'RE JUST A CAMERA WATCHING YOU TUBE I THINK THAT'S
1590_ben_goertzel|THAT CONNECTION
1590_russ_tedrake|VERY DIFFERENT PROBLEM THEN IF YOU ARE A
1593_ben_goertzel|BEAUTIFULLY POT
1593_russ_tedrake|I THINKS JUST AN EXCITING AREA OF RESEARCH I THINK YOU'RE PROBABLY RIGHT THAT THIS HASN'T BEEN UNDER RESEARCHED ATS THE
1594_ben_goertzel|IF IF WE ZUM OUT AND LOOK AT THIS PANDEMIC
1595_russ_tedrake|SUCH A RICH OPPORTUNITY
1596_russ_tedrake|TEXPORT TOUCH
1597_russ_tedrake|NOT EVEN FROM A SAFETY PROSPECTIVE BYLEGHE SAID EMOTIONAL TO MEAN SAFETY COMES FIRST
1601_russ_tedrake|JUST FEELS I GA
1602_russ_tedrake|IT'S NICE FOR THE ROBAT I DON'TNO  TYOU KNOW YYO MIGHT DISAGREE WITH IS PUT DAM
1606_ben_goertzel|VIRUSES ARE ALSO ADAPTING AND DIVIDING INTO NEW MUTENT STRAINS AND AND SO FORTH AND ULTIMATELY THE SOLUTION IS GOING TO BE
1607_russ_tedrake|A GOOD EXPERIENCE
1608_ben_goertzel|NOW NOW WE'UCK WIN THE
1609_ben_goertzel|BILOGICAL O MECHANISMS TO COMBAT THESE THESE VARISES HAM YET WE'VE BEEN
1609_russ_tedrake|THERE HAS TO BE A HUMAN
1610_russ_tedrake|I DON'T KNOW FOR ME I I IT FEELS LIKE LIKE AN INDUSTRIAL ROBODIC ARM
1612_russ_tedrake|DON'T KNO HOW A BIG BELIEVER IN THAT I I
1613_russ_tedrake|IT'S NOT MY AREA BUT I AM ALSO A BIG BELIEVER
1614_ben_goertzel|OF ANTIVARO
1616_russ_tedrake|YES IIN  I DON'T KNOW IF I'D MORE SO THAN IF I HAD A DIFFERENT SCIENCE PROJECT THAT I'D WORKED ON SNABERHARD RIGHT I BUT A
1618_ben_goertzel|REASONING IS INTERESTING T TIT CAN HELP WITH TRANSFER LEARNING WHEN YOU HAVE
1619_ben_goertzel|NOT THAT MANY DIFFERENT CASES TO STUDY AND QUALITATIVE DIFFERENCE EDIFFERENT
1621_russ_tedrake|EH I THINK THOSE UNIMPORTANT MOMENTS AND RABATICS
1622_ben_goertzel|THEYR SHARING DATY WITH US LIKE UNDERNON DISCLOSURE BUT WHAT SHOULD BE THE CASE IS LIKE
1623_russ_tedrake|A FELSIC ROBOTICS WILL BE IMPORTANT
1626_russ_tedrake|MAYBE THREE BOOKS TECHNICAL FICTION PHILOSOPHICAL THAT A
1628_russ_tedrake|YA SO EM I ACTUALLY DIDN'T READ THAT MUCH AS A KID BUT I READ FAIRLY VORACIOUSLY NOW EM
1629_russ_tedrake|THERE ARE SOME RECENT BOOKS THAT IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN
1630_ben_goertzel|WILL MOVEA
1631_ben_goertzel|AND CHINA FRICTIONS ARE GETTING
1632_russ_tedrake|THE FIRST ONE HOMODUS IS THE SECOND YE
1633_ben_goertzel|AS MOVING THE DIRECTION OF OPENLY SHARING DATA WITH EACH OTHER RIGHT IT IT'S NOT
1634_ben_goertzel|THERE'S SOME SHARING OF DATA
1635_ben_goertzel|BUT DIFFERENT GROUPS ARE KEEPING THE DATE O PRIVATE TILL THEY'VE MILK THE BEST RESULTS FROM IT AND THEN THEY SHER IT
1637_russ_tedrake|I LOVED IT
1639_russ_tedrake|OY WE'RE JUST INUNDATED WITH THE RESEARCH PAPERS THAT YOU COULD READ ON ARKIVE WITH
1640_ben_goertzel|REJOUVRE THAT WE SPUN OFF FROM SINGULARITY INA
1642_russ_tedrake|PASSION OF A WHAT YOU CAN GET OUT OF A BOOK A REALLY GOOD BOOK OR A REALLY GOOD PAPER IF YOU FIND IT
1643_russ_tedrake|THE ATTED TODE THE REALIZATION THAT YOU'RE ONLY GOING TO FIND A FEW THAT REALLY ARE WORTH ALL YOUR TIME AN
1646_russ_tedrake|THE SIDE NOTES SIDE MARGINTS AM
1647_russ_tedrake|THAT WAS REALLY
1649_ben_goertzel|EOPLE WEREN'T SEEING OTHERWISE ECAUSE THE THING IN THIS CASES
1650_ben_goertzel|FOR EACH COMBINATION OF ANTIVAROS YOU MAY HAVE ONLY A FEW PATIENTS HAV TRIED THE ACOMBINATION
1651_ben_goertzel|TRIED MORE UN YOUNG PEOPLE SO HOW DO YOU COMBINE THOSE
1651_russ_tedrake|A FEW COMPANIONS
1652_ben_goertzel|THOSE DIFFERENT PIECES OF DATA
1654_ben_goertzel|YBERD HYBERD A EY METHODOLOGY AND WE CAN
1656_ben_goertzel|BUT A AT THE SAME TIME IT'S ITS HIGHLY PRACTICAL RARCAUS WE'RE WORKING WHEN WERE WORKING WITH FOR EXAMPLE SOME
1657_ben_goertzel|PHYSICIANS ON THIS PROJECT IN THE
1658_ben_goertzel|OSITIONS IN THE GROUP CALLED
1659_russ_tedrake|OU KNOW I THE SOCRATES AND PLATO SAY AM
1660_russ_tedrake|THE THE WRITTEN WORD IS NEVRGUNA
1661_ben_goertzel|SE GOSIP WORKING
1661_russ_tedrake|CAPTURED THE BEAUTY OF DIALOGUE
1663_ben_goertzel|BUT MOSTLY
1663_russ_tedrake|A REALLY GOOD BOOK
1668_russ_tedrake|SCIENS FICTION WRITER ALSO EXUALLYS PENT A LOT OF HIS CAREER WRITING NON FICTION WRIGHT HIS MEMOIRS FANTASTIC
1671_ben_goertzel|THAT THAT  A LOT OF PAIN AND SUFFERING CAN HAPPEN IN THAT TIME SO I MAY THINK COULD BE IRREVERSIBLE O LI I THINK
1675_ben_goertzel|OF ANY LARGE
1676_russ_tedrake|JUST FORCES ME TO BE ROCXOLID AND ON THESE IDEAS IN A WAY THAT
1677_russ_tedrake|I DIDN'T HAVE THAT I I DON'T KNOW
1678_ben_goertzel|LYING BY THE SIDE OF THE ROAD
1678_russ_tedrake|I WOULD BE AT A DIFFERENT INTELLECTUAL SPACE ALSO VIDIOL ZEST CARR U THAT YOUR LECTURES ARE ON LINE
1679_ben_goertzel|DYING MANLY OF CURABLE DISEASES WITHOUT WITHOUT FOOD OR WATER
1680_russ_tedrake|SIPPING COFFEE AND WATCH SHE CAN GIVE LECTURES THAT I THINK I'S GREAT
1682_russ_tedrake|RIGHT NOW WERE GIVING THE LECTURES OVERZUME
1685_ben_goertzel|COVET IS BAD IT IS BY NO MEANS
1686_russ_tedrake|HAD BEEN QUITE A CYNICAL ABOUT THE HUMAN HUMAN CONNECTION OVER
1687_russ_tedrake|OVER THAT MEDIUM BUT I THINK THAT'S BECAUSE IT'S PEASANT BEEN EXPLORED FULLY AND TEACHING IS A DIFFERENT THING
1688_ben_goertzel|OF HAVING LET YOUR TEAN AGE SON KITEN UP BY ARMED MILITIAS  AND FORCED TO GET KILLE
1689_russ_tedrake|I IHEN I THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY TO TO GIVE THAT DIFFERENTLY I CAN
1690_russ_tedrake|I CAN DELIVER CONTENT DIRECTLY INTO YOUR BROWSER YOU HAVE A WEBGYELL ENGINE RIGHT THERE I COULD I CAN THROW
1691_ben_goertzel|WHICH WE DON'T NEED TO HAVE GIVEN THE STATE OF ADVANCEMENT OF UR OUR
1694_russ_tedrake|THAT'S A NEW COMMUNICATION TO  THAT I DIDN'T HAVE LAST YEAR RIGHT AND A
1695_ben_goertzel|MALARIA AFTER SO LONG AND AFTER THE GATES FOUNDATION IN OTHERS PUDDING PUTTING SO MUCH
1695_russ_tedrake|INK RUBOTICS CAN POTENTIALLY
1697_ben_goertzel|LEARLY THE WHOLE
1698_russ_tedrake|THE THE LENGTH OF LECTURES ARE THE LENGTH OF MY GOD
1699_russ_tedrake|TO FORCING YOURSELF TO CONDENSE AN IDEA TO
1700_ben_goertzel|INCREDIBLY UNEFICAL AND UNEQUAL AND AND BADLY DESIGNED AND
1700_russ_tedrake|SHORT AS POSSIBLE
1702_ben_goertzel|I THINK WHAT WE CAN DO INDIRECTLY TO SOLVE IT
1702_russ_tedrake|IVETY TEN MINUTES FROM AN OLER LECTURE
1703_russ_tedrake|ME I TICKS IT DEPENDS LIKE WOOD IS TEACHING YEEVE TO ASK EM
1704_ben_goertzel|IN PARALLEL AN
1707_ben_goertzel|AND MILITIAS AND TO THE EXTENT THAT YOU CAN MAKE COMPASSIONATE
1709_russ_tedrake|AR YO SHEE ME LOOKING DOWN THAT'S LAKE A SAFETY BLANKET THAT I'M TRYING TO LET GO OF MORMORE C
1714_ben_goertzel|IT'S KEY TO CREATE
1714_russ_tedrake|TOPIC AN
1715_russ_tedrake|YOU HAVE ADVICE LIKE WHAT ADVICE WOULD YOU GIVE TO A YOUNG
1716_russ_tedrake|PERSON ABOUT LIFE
1718_russ_tedrake|AH IT COULD BE IN RHOBATICS IT COULD BE IN LIFE IN GENERAL IT COULD BE A CAREER
1720_ben_goertzel|DESIGNED WITH UNIVERSAL COMPASSION AT THE CORPS
1720_russ_tedrake|THAT'S ONE OF THINGS I SEE YOU LIKE  TALK LIKE TWENTY YEAR OLD
1721_russ_tedrake|I THINK
1722_ben_goertzel|THESE WILL JUST DECREASE THE ROLE
1723_ben_goertzel|THAT GOVERNMENT HAS
1724_russ_tedrake|PEOPLE THAT WILL REALLY EXCEL
1725_ben_goertzel|DO GOOD AN TRYING TO ELECT
1725_russ_tedrake|IN MY OPINION ARE THE GOING TO BE THE ONES THAT CAN THINK DEEPLY ABOUT
1726_ben_goertzel|THE ENNER NUT OR
1727_russ_tedrake|I THINK
1728_ben_goertzel|SOMETHING THAT DECENTRALIZES
1728_russ_tedrake|THE THE LEADERS
1731_russ_tedrake|AND THAT'S A HARDER THING TO LEARN
1734_ben_goertzel|IS IS CERTAINLY
1736_russ_tedrake|THE LIFE THAT I'M LIVING NOW
1737_ben_goertzel|ORGANIZE AND THE CUSTOMER LIST IS PROPRIETARY TO TOIN THREE IN RECHTIN SO N YEI MEAN THAT THIS
1738_ben_goertzel|THIS I THINK IS A GREATER RISK
1738_russ_tedrake|TO DIG DEEP REALLY UNDERSTAND THINGS BUILDING THINGS TOO I MEAN
1740_ben_goertzel|THEN ROGUE A G EYES TURNING THE UNIVERSE INTO PAPER CLIPSE OR ERCOMPUTRONIUM
1740_russ_tedrake|SUCH A GOOD WAY TO REALLY
1741_ben_goertzel|IS WHAT YOU HAVE HERE IS MOSTLY GOOD HEARTED
1741_russ_tedrake|AND EXPECTED TO BE ALONG
1743_ben_goertzel|O ARE SUCKED INTO A MODE OF ORGANIZATION Y OF LARGE CORPORATIONS WHICH HAS EVOLVED
1744_russ_tedrake|TO THING DEEPLY AND STICK WITH IT ENJOY THE RIDE BUT JUST MAKE SURE YOU'RE NOT A
1745_russ_tedrake|YET JUST JUST MAKE SURE YOUR YOUR YOU'RE STOPPING TO THINK ABOUT WHY
1746_ben_goertzel|FACE BOOK I KNOW FEWER PEOPLE BUT IT'SPROBLY MOST AT'S PROBABLY MOSTLY TRUE IT'S PROBABLY LIK
1748_russ_tedrake|WERE OVERWHELMED WITH CONTENTRY NOW BUT
1750_ben_goertzel|THE GITS USED BY
1751_ben_goertzel|LIKE BILLIONS IN MILLIONS OF PEOPLE AND DO YOU THINK IF I IMPROVE THIS FEATURE
1751_russ_tedrake|ANIMAL FARM
1753_ben_goertzel|AND YOU KNOW THE ENGINEERS ARE NOT IN CHARGE OF RUNNING THE COMPANY ANYWAY AND OF COURSE EVEN IF YOU RE MARK ZAKEBERG OR OR LARRY PA JEMMYN

1772_russ_tedrake|I I LIKED COMPUTERS I'VE LIKED OUT A LIKED PROGRAMMING
1773_ben_goertzel|THE WHOLE MEST OF HUMANITY HAS MANY MANY VERY BAD ASPECTS TO IT
1774_russ_tedrake|THE CULTURE HERE WAS JUST DIFFERENT
1775_russ_tedrake|EN IT DEMANDED MORE OF ME CERTAINLY MATHEMATICALLY THAN IN THE CRITICAL THINKING
1776_russ_tedrake|THE DAY THAT AYA
1777_ben_goertzel|AS TRULY BENEVOLENT AN DOING GOOD THINGS IN ACCORDANCE WITH ITS INITIAL GOOD INTENTIONS
1777_russ_tedrake|BORROWED ONE OF THE BOOKS FROM MY ADVISER'S OFFICE AND WALKED DOWN TO T CHARLES RIVER AND WAS LIKE PAH

1820_ben_goertzel|KNO WEATHER USING THE SPECIFIC
1821_ben_goertzel|TECHNOLOGIES IAVE MENTIONED OR OR SOMETHING ELSE I MEAN THEN I THINK WE HAVE A HIGHER ODDS
1822_ben_goertzel|MOVING TOWARD
1830_ben_goertzel|TE GIVE OUR LIFE MEANING LIKE THE FACT THAT THIS THING ENDS THE FATHERLY THIMAM AMA
1832_ben_goertzel|I WOULD LOVE TO GET TIME
1833_ben_goertzel|TO REALLY PRODUCE MUSIC WELL LUCKI I I HAVEN'T TOUCHED MY SEQUENCOR SAL FORIN LIKE FIVE YEARS ICA I I WOULD LOVE TO
1835_ben_goertzel|WITH A TWO YEAR OLD BABY AND AND TRYING TO CREATE THE SINGULARITY THERE'S NO TIME SO I I JUST MADE THE DECISION TO
1836_ben_goertzel|PEOPLE CAN MAKE MEANING OUT OF
1838_ben_goertzel|DOESN'T MAKE TORTURE GOOD AND JUST BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE ABLE TO DERIVE MEANING AND VALUE FROM DEATH
1845_ben_goertzel|INSANELY OBVIOUS TO EVERYONE FIFTY YEARS FROM NOW AND THEY WILL BE SO
1848_ben_goertzel|DEATH IS IS IS GOOD BECAUSE
1849_ben_goertzel|BECAUSE YOU
1851_ben_goertzel|YOU KNOW THE FACT THAT I MIGHT HAVE ONLY A FEW MORE DECADES LEFT
1853_ben_goertzel|I MEAN SO WHAT YOU CUND GET A DEEP UNDERSTANDING AND IN A LOUT OF DIFFERENT WAY PAIN IS THE SAME WAY LIKE WERGAN TO ABOLISH PAIN
1861_ben_goertzel|REMANTHESIZE SUFFERING OR PAIN OR DEATH
1863_ben_goertzel|'S NON OBVIOUS WHATE YU CAN SAY IN THE PEOPLE'S ZU

1883_ben_goertzel|BILOGICAL MAKE UP WHICH
1884_ben_goertzel|OW FLEXIBLY CONE THAT
1885_ben_goertzel|MORF AS SOCIETY AND TECHNOLOGY CHANGE RIGHT SO IF IF WE'RE GIVEN THAT DIAL AND WE'RE GIVIN A SOCIETY
1893_ben_goertzel|CAN WE CONSISTENT AGAIN TO A STATE OF CONSCIOUSNESS
1894_ben_goertzel|WELL WE JUST WANT TO KEEP THE PENDIAL TURNS
1895_ben_goertzel|LL THE WAY  DOWN
1900_ben_goertzel|WHICH JUST DIDN'T NEED AN ANALOGUE OF FEELING PAIN
1903_ben_goertzel|ITHAT THIS IS THE NATURE OF THE HUMAN MOTIVATIONAL SYSTEM
1905_ben_goertzel|IN THE LARGE SCALE
1907_ben_goertzel|YOU SEE THAT IN IN MUSIC THERE'S A THEORY OF MUSIC WHICH SAYS THE KEY TO MUSICAL AESTHETICS
1910_ben_goertzel|YOU KNOW WE WANT TO HURT A LITTLE BIT
1912_ben_goertzel|WHAT IS THE MEANING OF LIFE
1916_ben_goertzel|ON THE OTHER HAND
1919_ben_goertzel|ELEMENT ELEMENT  HUPERVERSITY BUT THE IDEA
1926_ben_goertzel|FOR ASIS HUMANS
1928_ben_goertzel|IS TRANSHUMANISM AND TO GO BEYOND
1930_ben_goertzel|Y NO MEANS ANY OF US
1932_ben_goertzel|EMINENT IN OUR HUMAN BODIES ON THE OTHER HAND IT'S CLEAR THAT OTHER CONFIGURATIONS OF MATTER
1934_ben_goertzel|THAT T THEN HUMANS DO
1936_ben_goertzel|IN A PRACTICAL SENSE
